It is no coincidence that it was preceded by major pushback by American citizens against a governmental mass migration plan using H1B visas to bring masses of low paid Indians into the US in the tech sector, pushing out American workers. There is significant overlap between the American state’s mass migration problem and the UK’s, with their nations being the same if not unusually close. Essentially, the cosmobourgs wearing the civnat mask seek to frame migration as an easily resolved issue by merely weeding out the criminals among them. In the case of the UK, they point to the Pakistani Muslim hordes as disproportionately criminal.</p><p name="1d1c" id="1d1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, we can point out how mass migration tends to select for greater criminality: migrants are overwhelmingly single male who tend to commit the most crimes regardless, criminals in their own countries have incentive to move, etc. And with too much migration, migrants tend to create enclaves rather than assimilate, akin to sugar remaining at the bottom of the cup no matter how much it is mixed; this allows for migrants to occupy positions of power due to their numbers, which then creates diverging interests, and other problems associated with the national question remaining unresolved. The civnats attempt to subvert nationalists by using the Pakistani migrants as a scapegoat. By pressuring the current administration on this topic, they will seek an administration change and carry out arrests and deportations of Pakistanis to assuage and placate the masses.</p><p name="dee5" id="dee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they will retain Indians. Trump, Elon Musk, Poilievre, and other players have shown strong support for this group. Many Indians already know English, receive higher wages than in their own countries, are semi skilled, and are generally more supportive of imperial warmongering. Indians are mostly Hindu who have some historical opposition to Muslims so some ideological replacement is beneficial to garner support for continued Middle East war.</p><p name="718d" id="718d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are two interesting cases to point out to more closely illustrate the point. There was a car-ramming attack on a German Christmas market by a Saudi Arabian by the name of Taleb Abdulmohsen; with many large propaganda accounts and politicians claiming it was a Jihadi attack. As it turned out, he had posted a video claiming Germany was not as accepting of ex-Muslim migrants as they should be but also posting that Germany was not doing enough to stop Muslim migration; he was actually an atheist who was strongly pro Israel. His pro Israel posts were deleted by X, with few accounts deleting or even retracting their statements in light of the new information. In fact, some even claimed his posts were a facade to hide his so called true Jihadi intents, a facade he somehow held onto for decades and presented to the BBC when he was on television.</p><p name="5085" id="5085" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Afterwards, there was also another terror attack committed by a Shamsuddin Jabbar (who was part of the American Army for years) with an isis flag upsideown, and the fbi just happening to find a Quran opened at a page with a verse about martyrdom in his home (with a bomb making station and a Palestinian keffiyeh); we are told this because a Jewish reporter tells us; Jenny Taer was at the scene just 48 hours after the attack, somehow allowed to roam through the house by the authorities. The media was divided on these topics, as would be expected; the current administration sought to retain its power, while the other tries to topple it.</p><p name="fa45" id="fa45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are other civnat bases which are covered; people like Andrew Tate see this danger and lead a purer anti-crime party regardless of which group commits crimes, making for a less criminal yet still civic nationalist society, even as it is led by a migrant criminal. The crime problem is reduced at the expense of the national answer.</p><p name="ab60" id="ab60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Will the nationalists recognize the danger and muster enough principle not to be duped or assuaged by accepting a small level of deportation by the civnats? Or will the small victory placate the masses to cement the new administration to a new status quo?</p><p name="0e48" id="0e48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Zan Zazoorz 21/1/25</p><figure name="d273" id="d273" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*1-riMQk2AmXYWalA" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1-riMQk2AmXYWalA"></figure><p name="b231" id="b231" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="feb8" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5561" id="5561" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/01/21/subversion-of-english-nationalism-in-the-uk/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/01/21/subversion-of-english-nationalism-in-the-uk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on January 21, 2025.</em></p></div></div></section>
