One train began from Athens with destination Thessaloniki and the other, a freight train, began from Thessaloniki. Until now 57 people are found dead while the searches continue to find the missing people, most of the dead are young people (in the 20s mostly) since this line is regularly used from students, according to the data 80% of the 350 passengers were under 30 years old. This tragic accident was unfortunately excepted and while it was shocking it wasn’t surprising.</p><figure name="7070" id="7070" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*yQbEF8V1Xx082j-Q" data-width="422" data-height="522" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yQbEF8V1Xx082j-Q"></figure><p name="b149" id="b149" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As a matter of fact, the train drivers, workers and other unions and organizations warned the government and the ministry of transportation multiple times even highlighting the issue that led to this horrible accident. They reported the general poor and outdated infrastructure and specifically the absence or the inability to function of control systems and light signalling in order to track the trains positions and alert them, so they aren’t dependent on human error, also Greece as an EU country was supposed to meet the criteria of the ETCS (European Train Control System). In this case the stationmaster of Larisa made one mistake and didn’t notice (and then couldn’t see due to the absence of the control system) that two trains were in the same line for almost 3km.</p><p name="cf39" id="cf39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This accident is another consequence of the mismanagement and lack of funding that the Greek state faces, especially after the infamous TROIKA era in Greece. The organization that manages the railways “Hellenic Train” was privatised in 2017 and is now part of “Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane” Italy’s national state-owned railway holding company. The privatisation was done by the SYRIZA government of Tsipras and continued but the Mitsotakis government, which made a lot of empty promises for modernization of the railways. Mitsotakis government and its lackeys in cooperations with the media have started a campaign to blame this tragedy on the Larisa stationmaster only, they don’t mention the state of Greek railways and of course after 3 years of continuous privatising of state entities and organizations and the slandering of anyone who dare to oppose this, they are keeping quiet! Now that the greatest tragedy in the Greek railway history happened Mitsotakis doesn’t boast about how the great Capitalists, that sit in their luxurious offices and houses with their companies that avoid taxes, will save us from the mismanagement of public sector. The government hasn’t addressed the claims that are made from stationmasters and union leaders or simply workers, because they simply can’t. How can the government react to the claim of Nikos Tsikalakis, head of the Association of Rail Workers, that “The state has voted and has said, itself, that there should be 2,100 workers on the railroad when today there are 750 people who serve it all over Greece”. How can even the government keep quiet when they have people in the government like Adonis Georgiadis, Minister for Development and Investment and Vice President of the ruling party, that as Minister of Health was yelling “I will fire them (doctors and state workers) not TROIKA, TROIKA shouldn’t take the glory from me”. Its people like him that run this country for years and years and lead us to these situations and tragedies.</p><p name="006a" id="006a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the accident the Minister of Transportations Karamanlis resigned, while a part of the blame is his obviously, he isn’t alone. Has Mitsotakis resigned? Has Tsipras at least even apologised for the privatising of the company? But these are just people, they don’t make the system, the system makes them. This system is the death of Greece and the death of its people, and one can see it from the way that protesters or even mourning students were treated. In the Thessaloniki students gathered peacefully outside of the office of the Railway to remember, honour and mourn the victims and the government sent armed to the teeth police officers and the special protest Unit, known for the violence, creating images of a dystopian society. While in Athens protests outside of the HQ of the Railways organizations and in the centre took place, once again the government sent the MAT units leading to escalation while they have declared 3 days of national mourning.</p><figure name="1198" id="1198" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*5yOO91IwJ5r5nx8G" data-width="423" data-height="533" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5yOO91IwJ5r5nx8G"></figure><p name="5c0a" id="5c0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Greece is in shock and mourning as people realised that anyone could be in that train even themselves, their children, brothers, sisters, co-workers and friends. This tragedy happened when Greece is in a 10-year crisis that as a Greek saying says, “Every last year is getting better”.</p><p name="835c" id="835c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Platon Stafa, 3/3/2023</p></div></div></section><section name="75df" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1eab" id="1eab" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/03/03/train-crash-in-greece/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/03/03/train-crash-in-greece/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on March 3, 2023.</em></p></div></div></section>
