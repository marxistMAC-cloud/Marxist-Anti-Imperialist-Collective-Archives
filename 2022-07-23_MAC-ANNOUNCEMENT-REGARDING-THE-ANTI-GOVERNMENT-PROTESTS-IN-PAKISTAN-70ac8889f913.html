In short, according to our analysis, the PTI presents the organized anti-imperialist oriented, national bourgeoisie with its own limitations (they havent fully broken with imperialism to pursue a full national development, but they are not fully sticken to them either, rather, they try to use the imperialists for their own ends, which obviously failed), and the current government which initiated the coup, the Pakistan Democratic Movement, represents the major compradorist elements of the country, which under probable directives from their puppet masters, and with help from the Army and ISI, they now rule the country. Under these, we have the following to say to our readers:</p><p name="e2f7" id="e2f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1) The current government must be opposed for its completely anti-popular, anti-worker, compradorist attitude. This government will undue whatever the previous national bourgeoisie governments managed to do in Pakistan, making it somehow independent (or at least, whoever independent one can be without almost or completely breaking with imperialism), and therefore it is completely reactionary and must be removed for the sake of Pakistan’s masses.</p><p name="c6e6" id="c6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2) The pro-PTI and their allies (the Grand democratic alliance, e.t.c) protesters, must be fully supported against the Army, ISI, and the PDM and all compradorist movements in the country. In general, our support stands with the workers of Pakistan, who while their end goal should be not the keeping of either capitalist regime (compradorist or national anti-imperialist), their best immediate interest lies with the overthrow of PDM and the compradorist elements who will doubly enslave them, and the re-installation of the popular, Khan government.</p><figure name="ef9b" id="ef9b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Av0ksosTbUdi9q94" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Av0ksosTbUdi9q94"></figure><figure name="1f74" id="1f74" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*9Ih-JUF_WVoZb3TZ" data-width="1" data-height="1" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9Ih-JUF_WVoZb3TZ"></figure></div></div></section><section name="1101" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="acb4" id="acb4" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/07/23/mac-announcement-regarding-the-anti-government-protests-in-pakistan/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/07/23/mac-announcement-regarding-the-anti-government-protests-in-pakistan/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on July 23, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
