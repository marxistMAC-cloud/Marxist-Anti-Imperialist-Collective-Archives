This overcompensation to counter claims of anti-semitism by constantly making the point of “judaism is seperate from zionism”, prefacing all criticisms of zionism and Israel with “not all jews” and kissing the ring of the global jewry at every conceivable point precisely furthers the agenda of global zionism.</p><p name="10b3" id="10b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is zionism other than honest and open judaism? Violent chauvinism towards all nations in favor of the made up “jewish nation”, and Israel is the materialization of this ideology. The leftist zionist simply leaves out the violent part, yet retains the essence of zionism, that jews constitute a nation, which itself denies the existence of nations and is supreme cosmopolitanism. This in itself forms an inner contradiction in zionism, between the emerging Hebrew nationalists and the zionists, but this is another topic. This helps the zionist agenda :</p><p name="8738" id="8738" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1) by confiscating the Jewish Question, one cannot at the same time be pro-jew/judaism and at the same time uphold an ideology that denies the existence of the jews as more than an ideology, ie. anti-zionism.</p><p name="9948" id="9948" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2)In the long run the leftist with his anti-nationalist rhetoric supports the global jewry in its goal of destroying nations (something certain flavors of communism, like trotskyists, openly support).</p><p name="a7cf" id="a7cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3) by associating anti-zionism in the West with the effeminate and unlikeable hippies and intellectuals, effectively alienating the masses from anti-zionism, this is further enforced by the associating of anti-zionism with islamism, largely done by muslim immigrants in the West. This leads to a situation where a principled anti-zionist in the West will likely not want to voice his disdain for Israel out loud, so as not to be grouped together with the irritating liberal crowds, although he’d likely be called a nazi by said liberals if he did.</p><p name="01c2" id="01c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The leftist “anti-zionist” thus isn’t an anti-zionist at all, but merely the left wing of zionism, seeking to rehabilitate zionism from the violent image given to it by the state of Israel. They implicitly support zionism with its thesis on nations, and violently oppose actual anti-zionism which posits that there can be no anti-zionist jew, as the entire jewish identity, be it the religious type or the secular one based on pseudo science about “jewish DNA”, is based on zionism and cannot exist outside of it. These leftist “anti-zionists” are happy then to join the zionists in calling anti-zionists nazis, and demanding their censoring by the imperialist bourgeoise.</p><p name="c63d" id="c63d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Real anti-zionism demands the abolition of the Israeli state and the assimilation of the global jewry into their respective nations, with force or without. To free the world from zionism, we must free the world of judaism. The words written by Marx almost 200 years ago are still true today;</p><p name="c8ec" id="c8ec" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism — huckstering and its preconditions — the Jew will have become impossible, because his consciousness no longer has an object, because the subjective basis of Judaism, practical need, has been humanized, and because the conflict between man’s individual-sensuous existence and his species-existence has been abolished.<br>The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism.</em> “</p><p name="7629" id="7629" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">V.
