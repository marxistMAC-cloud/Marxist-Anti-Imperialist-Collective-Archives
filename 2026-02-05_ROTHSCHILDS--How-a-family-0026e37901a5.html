They are the frequent subject of “conspiracy theories”, some of them more baseless than others. Consequently, many people are quick to decry any actual facts about the Rothschilds as baseless theory, when in reality, many of these facts are openly acknowledged by the Rothschild family today.</p><p name="bcd6" id="bcd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will be dealing primarily with the facts and not the theories. We see that the Rothschild family exists, and we see that they arouse suspicion (to say the least) from no small number of people. So, what is the source of these feelings? Why are “conspiracy theories” about them so popular? That is what we are curious about here.</p><p name="0356" id="0356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So that no accusation of bias may be leveled against us, we will rely mostly on three sources — all information which is not otherwise cited is either common knowledge or may be found in these three sources:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="fb10" id="fb10" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The Rothschild Archives, an online database of various sources and data on the Rothschild family, today managed and edited by their own Eric Rothschild. (1)</li><li name="03bf" id="03bf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The entry Rothschilds from the 20th century Jewish Encyclopedia by Isidore Singer, a work the American Jewish Archives calls “the most monumental Jewish scientific work of our times” (2).</li><li name="4333" id="4333" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">And the entry Rothschild in Encyclopedia Britannica, which can absolutely not be said to “have it out” for the Rothschilds and global finance banking, a system that surely improves rather than worsens the condition of the article’s author, Jean Bouvier, a French liberal economist and professor at the University of Paris. (3)</li></ul><p name="dbd7" id="dbd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">With that said, who are the Rothschilds, and where do they come from?</p><h4 name="217f" id="217f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">THE GENESIS OF THE ROTHSCHILDS</h4><p name="96f1" id="96f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Rothschilds find their origin in the 16th century German Izaak Elchanan zum Rothenschild, “Izaak Elchanan with the Red Shield” (1), a Jewish banker serving in the court of the noble Georg von Hesse-Darmstadt in the Holy Roman Empire. Banking was a very common profession for European Jews at the time due to particular historical and social circumstances. The American Jewish Committee writes:</p><blockquote name="d079" id="d079" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In the Middle Ages — when Christians were forbidden by the Church to lend money for interest — money-lending, trade, and commerce were the few professions Jews were allowed to have. Jews were blamed for usury, or the act of charging high rates of interest, and this association led to stereotypes about Jewish greed and wealth. (4)</blockquote><p name="f455" id="f455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As a people, Jews descended from those who lived in the Ancient Kingdoms of Israel and Judea. Occupying a critical intersection among various trade routes, the Jews had been primarily urban craftsmen, merchants, and moneylenders. Through the course of several invasions and conquests, the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea fell to history. The Jews were enslaved and sold throughout Europe, and in every country, they found themselves segregated into the “ghettos”, crowded city-sections where the Jews rarely left and non-Jews rarely entered. This segregation enabled the preservation of the Jewish identity for centuries until the Industrial Revolution, when poorer Jews left the ghettos permanently to find work in the factories, thus assimilating into broader society.</p><p name="d9af" id="d9af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, the wealthier Jews never assimilated, since they had no reason to find work in a factory. Their mastery of banking was continuously employed by nobles and statesmen well into the Industrial Revolution and afterwards. The generational passing of this expertise, along with the preservation of the Jewish identity despite the fall of the ghettos, was a feat accomplished through their particular religion, Judaism, which in its holy books contains various instructions on money lending, investment, and finance. Rabbi Asher Meir of the Center of Jerusalem explains:</p><blockquote name="088a" id="088a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Sages of the Talmud gave a great deal of useful practical advice, and one issue they discuss is investment. Rebbe Yitzchak said: “A person should always have his money at hand.” Rebbe Yitzchak said, “A person should always divide his money into three: one third in land, one third in commerce, and one third at hand.” Prudent investment is part of a broader religious ideal. (5)</blockquote><p name="7004" id="7004" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Izaak Elchanan zum Rothenschild and the Rothschild family were no exception to this historical pattern. For centuries, they dwelled in the Ghetto of Frankfurt, the so-called Judengaas (“Alley of Jews”), and remained of no particular importance to world history beyond their longstanding role as coin-minters and financiers for the nobles of various German courts, typically centered around Hesse. The Rothschild family only arrived at its world-historical significance with Mayer Amschel Rothschild in the 18th century.</p><p name="fecc" id="fecc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like his ancestors, Mayer Amschel was a coin-minter for the Prince of Hesse-Kassel, and was thus well connected to the German nobility. In 1766, he created the family’s first official bank, which would serve as the embryo of all the later Rothschild enterprises. In time, Mayer Amschel had five sons — Amschel, Salomon, Nathan, Carl, and James — who would all join in his business, which in 1810 was renamed to MA Rothschild &amp; Sons.</p><p name="3418" id="3418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through this institution, Mayer Amschel would become the foremost international finance banker by the turn of the 19th century, and today his admirers bestow on him the rightful title of the “first international banker”. Encyclopedia Britannica says his family became “the most famous European banking dynasty in modern history,” and that “for some 200 years they exerted great influence on the economic and, indirectly, the political history of Europe.”</p><p name="882f" id="882f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Torah commands: “Leave your country, your people and your household and go to the land I will show you,” (Genesis 12:1–3) and “exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your God will choose.” (Deuteronomy 14:25). The Rothschilds followed these instructions closely: over the course of 1800–1830, the sons of Mayer Amschel would move to various European countries and establish new banks which remained linked to the central bank in Frankfurt. The central bank itself was structured as a cartel:</p><p name="6465" id="6465" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The two guidelines laid down by Mayer Amschel for the Rothschild business operations (which, indeed, became a family tradition) — to conduct all transactions jointly [among the family] and never to aim for excessive profits — helped to compensate to a notable extent for the inevitable risks inherent in handing down a business to future generations.</p><blockquote name="7b09" id="7b09" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Further rules for the bank included:</blockquote><blockquote name="68d3" id="68d3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">All executive positions must be held by Rothschilds.</blockquote><blockquote name="a3d8" id="a3d8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The head of the family shall descend along a system of primogeniture, oldest-son inheritance, like a hereditary title.</blockquote><blockquote name="b79b" id="b79b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Take no legal inventory and publish no information on assets.</blockquote><p name="b238" id="b238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It should be apparent to the reader why some people might not be quick to trust the family. The bank was essentially a noble court in practice, a business in form. And, like all nobility, the Rothschilds practiced copious amounts of incest — most of the family’s girls were married to a first cousin, uncle, etc. Any who did not marry incestuously usually married actual nobility or members of other prominent banking families — these marriages were generally arranged by the parents long beforehand. Let us look at James Mayer and his wife Betty, who was also his niece — they married in 1824. All last names in the following chart are pre-marriage names, so that they indicate the original family the spouse comes from.</p><p name="17a0" id="17a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">James Rothschild<br>m.

Etienne Nyevelt, Belgian athlete</p><p name="89c5" id="89c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is only a very shallow picture of the extent to which incestuous marriage was practiced among the Rothschilds. By the second generation descending from father Mayer Amschel, we are left with seventeen Rothschilds, plus the original five men. Of these twenty-two fellows, fifteen were married incestuously. By the fourth generation, the British banker Nathan Rothschild would marry his cousin Emma Louise: they shared not only both grandparents on the maternal side, but on the paternal side too, making them “double-first-cousins” — it is an undeniable fact that a “double-first-cousin-wife” is something which requires generations of incest to even render possible. James Rothschild also married his seventeen year old cousin Dorothy when he was thirty-five; and so on, the reader gets the point and may look further into that if they wish.</p><p name="804f" id="804f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The incest is important to note because, while it may seem like only a bizarre “quirk”, it is actually an economic mechanism. Whether the Rothschilds intend for it or not, incest has the inevitable effect of preventing wealth from being inherited outside of the family, because the women rarely produce heirs for a non-Rothschild. Whether the Rothschilds committed to incest deliberately for this purpose is a matter of debate, but we should again consult the book they consider sacred, which directs that “Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite family must marry someone in her father’s family, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors.” (Numbers 36:8).</p><p name="c050" id="c050" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In those few cases where there is no incest, the Rothschilds partake in marriages with other prominent monopolists, financiers, nobility, and so on. For example: of the original ten children of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, Schonche Jeanette Rothschild married Benedikt Moses Worms, an Austrian aristocrat (their grandson, Solomon Benedict de Worms, became a Member of the British Parliament). Salomon Mayer married Caroline Stern, a Jewish banker from Frankfurt (her brother founded the Banque Stern, now Stern &amp; Cie, and together her family owned shares alongside the Rothschilds in the Banque de France); the Oppenheim family, about the 30th richest in Germany, married into the Rothschilds in 1834 through Charlotte Beyfus, daughter of Babette Rothschild, and in 1923, James Nathaniel Rothschild married Claud du Pont of the famous du Pont family, one of the richest in America today. The Bonaparte family, which had fallen from grace at the hands of Nathan Mayer over a century prior, married into the Rothschilds through the 1974 union of the still-living (and still-married) Princess Olympia Bonaparte and David Rothschild. That fellow who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo (and who gave Nathan Mayer control of his finances), the Duke Arthur Wellesley of Wellington, had his great-great-granddaughter Pamela Wellesley marry in through the Lieutenant Charles Grant, a fourth-generation Rothschild. Anita Guinness, from the Irish family that invented Guinness Beer, married in through Amschel Mayer James in 1957, and there was also very recently the marriage of James Rothschild and Nicky Hilton in 2015, Hilton being the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, founder of Hilton Hotels. The Prince Alexander de Wagram, the Countess Cathleen de Schonborn, and members of the Jewish banking dynasties Goldsmith, Ephrussi, Guggenheim, and so on — these have all married into the Rothschilds too.</p><p name="d5cc" id="d5cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, a new phenomenon occurs in the non-incestuous marriages which is impossible not to take note of: that of infidelity, divorce, and remarriages with questionable age dynamics. For example: by the mid 1900s we have Eugene Daniel, who married Catherine Wolff only to give her up for the actress Jeanne Stuart, twenty-two years his junior. Gustave Samuel, who defied the planned marriage with his cousin Evelina by marrying the daughter of a high ranking French official, would also end up partaking in an extramarital affair with the journalist and publisher Marguerite Durand, though his marriage lasted through it. There is then the more recent Guy Rothschild who would end up married to Alix Korolma, only to later divorce her and marry the socialite Marie-Helene Nyevelt (who herself had just been divorced from the noble Francois de Nicolay after they had produced a son), this time eighteen years his junior. Their son, Edouard, married Mathilde de la Ferte, divorcing her in less than a decade for Arielle Mallard, who was six years younger and an employee of Lazard Frères, one of the Rothschild’s own banking branches. Very recently was the 39 year-old Kate Rothschild who was divorced by her wealthy cousin Ben Goldsmith in 2013 when he found out that she had been having an affair with the hip-hop artist Jay Electronica.</p><p name="91d4" id="91d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, we are not concerned with their family lives. We are concerned with the role they played in cosmopolitan finance. Let us pass on to the transformation of the Rothschild banking dynasty into a banking empire.</p><h4 name="a216" id="a216" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">FROM DYNASTY TO EMPIRE</h4><p name="8ed6" id="8ed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Mayer Amschel’s first son, the creatively named Amschel Mayer, stayed in Frankfurt and managed the original bank with his father; he would inherit it after his father died in 1812. From its founding, the bank rapidly grew through loans given out to German nobility. In 1794, the Rothschilds reaped an amount today worth $20 million while helping the Hessian Crown Prince exchange British gold, and in 1800, the Prince of Hesse loaned the Rothschilds silver today amounting to about $6 million, which was promptly sunk into various German towns and businesses. When Napoleon’s soldiers entered Hesse in 1811, the Prince fled to Denmark and left Amschel Mayer and his son with the court’s possessions, today altogether worth about $103 million. Napoleon’s soldiers didn’t dare tamper with Rothschild or his treasures: the Napoleonic puppet-Duke of Hesse, Karl von Dahlberg, had lent Nathan Mayer an amount akin to $137 million a few years prior, and remained on good terms with the Rothschild family bank even throughout the occupation — Mayer Amschel was even made a Prince in Darmstadt under von Dahlberg’s rule. After the fall of Napoleon, Amschel Mayer remained in Frankfurt, becoming styled a Baron by the German nobility and then dying in 1855 without having produced any children.</p><p name="36c0" id="36c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Salomon Mayer Rothschild, the second son of Mayer Amschel, would leave Frankfurt and settle in Austria, where he founded the Austrian branch of the family bank. He too was made a noble, this time an Austrian one, being knighted in 1816 by King Ferdinand I and IV (just one person). The massive and still operating Nordbahn railroad built under the rule of that same Ferdinand was financed almost entirely from Salomon’s pocket. By 1842 Salomon had purchased most of the coal mines in the Bohemian city of Ostrava along with the entirety of Dalmatia’s asphalt industry, and the next year, he would become the first Jew to be granted Austrian citizenship. With his fortune he commissioned three great estates: Oderberg, Hultschin, and Schillersdorf. Outside of Austria, Salomon became one of the principal investors of Rothschild Frères Bank in France, at that time owned by his son-in-law and brother James Mayer. He had also been placed on the governing board of the Viennese Bank, the central bank of Austria, by Prince Klemens Metternich. However, the 1848 Revolutions in Austria would force Salomon to flee and retire in Paris.</p><p name="df1a" id="df1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mayer Amschel’s third son, Nathan Mayer, was by far the most significant. He is generally credited as having been the richest man in history behind John D. Rockefeller. In 1798, Nathan Mayer left for England with an amount today worth $3.5 million in his pocket; by 1804, it had grown to $6.8 million. It was then that he founded NM Rothschild &amp; Co., a subsidiary of the Frankfurt bank — this institution would grow to be the largest of the Rothschild banks and today it forms the base of the massive Rothschild &amp; Co.</p><p name="e0b1" id="e0b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nathan Mayer was also a Freemason, belonging to what Britannica calls “the world’s oldest and largest secret society” as a member of the “Emulation Lodge №12”. I have written of Masonry’s curiously extensive influence in Freemasons: The World Historical Cartel (i). In fact, we will see that the Rothschilds in general have had an extremely close relationship with Freemasonry. This is not a conspiracy theory: the Rothschild family openly boasts of the family’s connections to Masonry on their own Rothschild Archive:</p><blockquote name="6929" id="6929" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Members of the Rothschild family have been involved with the Freemasons, a fraternal organisation whose members are concerned with moral and spiritual values, self-improvement, and helping their communities with charitable endeavours. (6)</blockquote><p name="2c99" id="2c99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Archive says that through the Rothschilds, multiple Masonic Lodges have been set up and financed, enabling the family to remain in close contact with high ranking nobles including Kings and Emperors — that is for the reader to explore on their own with the given source, if they would like.</p><p name="87fe" id="87fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for what Freemasonry entails, I think it is best summed up by the Masons’ own New Age Magazine:</p><blockquote name="ad60" id="ad60" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Freemasonry is dedicated to the unification of all races, religions and creeds. This plan, dedicated to the new order of things, is to make all things new — a new nation, a new race, a new civilization and a new religion. Just as Providence has chosen the Jewish race, so also Providence has chosen the Nordic Race, to unfold the ‘New Age’ of the world — a ‘Novus Ordo Seclorum’ [New Order for the Ages]. (7)</blockquote><p name="cfd2" id="cfd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It was through the Napoleonic Wars in particular that Nathan Mayer and the rest of his family would become solidified as a banking empire. Britannica describes the Rothschild’s involvement in the wars as such:</p><p name="a7cd" id="a7cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The wars, for the Rothschilds, meant loans to warring princes; smuggling as well as legal trading in key products such as wheat, cotton, colonial produce, and arms; and the transfer of international payments between the British Isles and the Continent that Napoleon vainly attempted to close to British trade. Peace transformed the growing Rothschild business: the banking group continued its international business dealings but became more and more an agent in government securities (Prussian or English, French or Neapolitan), in insurance-company stocks, and in shares of industrial companies.</p><p name="d251" id="d251" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From 1813 to 1815, Nathan Mayer received about an amount today worth $2.58 billion from the British nobility, and then another $172 million in 1816. In 1815 alone, Nathan Mayer loaned gold today worth $1 billion to the British in war subsidies, on top of serving as the de-facto financial overseer of Britain’s military, having been put in charge of gold logistics. This gave rise to the Waterloo story, which we will leave the reader to explore on their own.</p><p name="77cd" id="77cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And this was not even the most questionable act by the Freemason Rothschild (and we should say that at this point in time, George IV, King of Britain, was also a Mason). Nathan Mayer also re-purchased the gold he had sold to the British Army and then resold it to Portugal, making three profits on the same gold.</p><p name="bf2a" id="bf2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps it is also relevant to mention that the King of Britain at the time, George IV, was a Mason of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, while Napoleon had his own allegiance with Freemasonry, though less direct. According to the Masonic Lodge Michal Kleofas Oginski of Belarus:</p><blockquote name="9703" id="9703" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Was Napoleon a Freemason? Historians do not have a document that could confirm this, but many undeniable facts prove the extreme closeness of Napoleon to Freemasonry. Moreover, it was thanks to Napoleon that Freemasonry spread in Europe and became a mass phenomenon. He turned Freemasonry from a secret society, as it used to be, into almost an official state religion, uniting all the French lodges around the Grand Orient de France. (8)</blockquote><p name="5ffc" id="5ffc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It was put a bit more bluntly in Napoleon’s own words:</p><blockquote name="6549" id="6549" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Freemasons are a pile of imbeciles who assemble for good cheer and for the execution of many ridiculous follies. Nevertheless, they carry out good actions from time to time. (9)</blockquote><p name="70ed" id="70ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">After the Napoleonic Wars, Nathan Mayer and his cousin Moses Montefiore founded Alliance Assurance, which would go on in 1959 to merge with Sun Insurance, “the world’s first insurance company” in the words of the International Risk Management Institute (10). Like Rothschild, Montefiore was a Freemason, and Sun Insurance also used the sixteen-pointed sun with a face (a famously common symbol in Masonry) as their company logo (10). The company still lives on as the Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Group, a London firm that generates about $8 billion a year according to Forbes. (11)</p><p name="e200" id="e200" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1834 Nathan Mayer managed to defeat a combined syndicate of the Fould, Oppenheim, and Pereire families, as well as others, in securing a loan from the Pope through Sardinia, and a year later, he procured a contract with the Spanish Crown granting the Rothschilds a monopoly over Iberia’s mercury mines. By his death in 1836, Nathan Mayer alone had attained a net worth amounting to about $250 billion in today’s money, with an unknown amount controlled through his bank and family. If Nathan Rothschild was alive now, he would still be the richest man in the world, surpassing Bezos and his $180 billion.</p><p name="a60a" id="a60a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fourth son, Carl Mayer, would form the Italian branch of the Rothschild dynasty, specifically in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. His side of the dynasty did not turn out as successfully for political reasons we won’t get into here.</p><p name="8bdc" id="8bdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fifth and final son was James Mayer, who married Betty von Rothschild, daughter of his brother Salomon Mayer. In 1811, James Mayer travelled to Paris and founded the French branch of the family bank. Here, he would be loaned an amount today worth $3 billion by the French government; he spent the Napoleonic Wars secretly transferring this gold to the Duke of Wellington through Nathan Mayer. This gave rise to the popular myth that the Rothschilds “played both sides” of the Napoleonic War — except this is not much of a myth at all. Still, credit where it is due — they primarily financed the winning side, the British.</p><p name="5d3b" id="5d3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">James Mayer would not actually settle permanently in France until 1830. The Jewish Encyclopedia says that by that time, James Mayer had already befriended the French King Louis Philippe I, having been knighted in 1823. Upon settling down, James Mayer was made the King’s personal banker, the intermediary agent between the global stock market and French monarchy. He served in this royal financial position for eighteen years, and in 1846, he was granted a massive governmental concession of shares in the French Great Northern Railway Company as if it were a gift. The French Liberal Revolution of 1848 saw the King deposed, but this was no matter — James Mayer stayed in France, and in 1854, he commissioned the Chateau de Ferrières, which was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by the Emperor Napoleon III. The French branch, along with the English branch, are the two most active today.</p><p name="b24f" id="b24f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In review: the British branch, NM Rothschild &amp; Co., was founded in 1804; in 1810 came the MA Rothschild &amp; Sons bank; in 1820, Salomon founded the Austrian branch of the bank; and in 1821, Carl Mayer founded the Italian branch. Mayer Amschel, Amschel Mayer’s first son, was given partial control of AM Rothschild &amp; Sons, with Amschel Mayer intending him to inherit it fully. With Mayer Amschel’s death, the property was taken over by sons from the other branches. All five of the original sons were inducted into the nobilities of various countries during their lifetimes. The Napoleonic Wars specifically propelled the Rothschilds into a global banking power, and with the money gained throughout the conflict, the Rothschilds loaned hefty sums to the ruined French people for their “reconstruction”, and so France was reborn in its cradle, this time to be raised anew by their father Rothschild; and France, like any daughter of the Rothschilds, was then ordered to marry her cousins. The post-war period in the early 19th century marks the rise of international finance banking, and so France became tied to Britain, Britain to Italy, Italy to Spain, Spain to Germany; in a word, all of Europe to global banking, and thus to the Rothschilds.</p><p name="ed27" id="ed27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we said earlier, the Rothschilds as a principle keep public information about their company to a minimum. However, it goes without saying that owning the world market will as a matter of fact lead to some information becoming known. The Jewish Encyclopedia does us a massive favor when it compiles a list of major loans granted by the Rothschilds directly to the ruling governments of various European countries in the period of 1817 to 1848. The following is by no means the full extent of the Rothschilds, but it certainly helps give perspective.</p><p name="de31" id="de31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jewish Encyclopedia gives us a chart using mostly 1904 gold values, so we will first look at the chart un-adjusted for inflation.</p><p name="d7e1" id="d7e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Year — Country — Amount</p><p name="7570" id="7570" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1817 — Prussia — 1,500,000 gulden<br>1818 — “ — £5,000,000<br>1819 — Great Britain — £12,000,000<br>1820 — Austria — 48,000,000 gulden<br>1820 — “ — 20,800,000 “<br>1821 — “ — 37,500,000 “<br>1821 — Naples — 16,000,000 ducats<br>1821 — Sicily — 4,500,000 “<br>1822 — Prussia — £3,500,000<br>1822 — Russia — £3,500,000<br>1822 — “ — £6,500,000<br>1822 — Naples — 20,000,000 ducats<br>1823 — Austria — £2,500,000<br>1823 — “ — 25,000,000 gulden<br>1823 — France — 23,000,000 francs<br>1824 — Brazil — £3,200,000<br>1824 — Naples — £2,500,000<br>1825 — Grand Duchy of Hesse — 6,500,000 gulden<br>1825 — Brazil — £2,000,000<br>1829 — “ — £800,000<br>1829 — “ — 25,000,000 gulden<br>1829 — Hesse-Homburg — 1,750,000 “<br>1829 — Hohenzollern-Hechingen — 260,000 “<br>1830 — Prussia — £4,500,000<br>1831 — Belgium — 50,000,000 francs<br>1831 — Papal States — 16,000,000 “<br>1832 — Belgium — £2,000,000<br>1834 — Austria — 25,000,000 gulden<br>1834 — Greece — 66,000,000 francs<br>1834 — Grand Duchy of Hesse — 2,500,000 gulden<br>1835 — Great Britain — £15,000,000<br>1837 — Duchy of Nassau — 2,600,000 gulden<br>1839 — Austria — 30,000,000 “<br>1840 — Duchy of Lucea — 1,050,000 “<br>1840 — Baden — 5,000,000 “<br>1842 — Austria — 40,000,000 “<br>1843 — Duchy of Lucea — 1,120,000 “<br>1845 — Papal States — 2,160,000 francs<br>1845 — Baden — 14,000,000 gulden<br>1847 — Irish Famine Loan — £10,000,000<br>1847 — France — 250,000,000 francs<br>1847 — Hanover — 3,600,000 thaler<br>1848 — Baden — 2,500,000 gulden<br>1848 — Bavaria — 22,000,000 “<br>1848–51 — Hesse (four loans) — 6,500,000 “</p><p name="255a" id="255a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adjusted for inflation, it looks something like this.</p><p name="6e83" id="6e83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Year — Country — Amount</p><p name="ce2b" id="ce2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1817 — Prussia — $66,738,897<br>1818 — “ — $861,170,027<br>1819 — Great Britain — $2,066,650,910<br>1820 — Austria — $1,536,000,000<br>1820 — “ — $665,600,000<br>1821 — “ — $1,200,000,000<br>1821 — Naples — $512,000,000<br>1821 — Sicily — $144,000,000<br>1822 — Prussia — $602,598,565<br>1822 — Russia — $602,598,565<br>1822 — Naples — $640,000,000<br>1823 — Austria — $430,483,673<br>1823 — “ — $800,000,000<br>1823 — France — $113,793,508<br>1824 — Brazil — $551,019,102<br>1824 — Naples — $430,483,673<br>1825 — Grand Duchy of Hesse — $208,000,000<br>1825 — Brazil — $344,354,011<br>1829 — “ — $137,737,313<br>1829 — “ — $800,000,000<br>1829 — Hesse-Homburg — $56,000,000<br>1829 — Hohenzollern-Hechingen — $8,320,000<br>1830 — Prussia — $774,772,391<br>1831 — Belgium — $247,377,193<br>1831 — Papal States — $79,160,701<br>1832 — Belgium — $344,293,394<br>1834 — Austria — $800,000,000<br>1834 — Greece — $326,537,895<br>1834 — Grand Duchy of Hesse — $80,000,000<br>1835 — Great Britain — $2,583,190,159<br>1837 — Duchy of Nassau — $83,200,000<br>1839 — Austria — $960,000,000<br>1840 — Duchy of Lucea — $33,600,000<br>1840 — Baden — $160,000,000<br>1842 — Austria — $1,280,000,000<br>1843 — Duchy of Lucea — $35,840,000<br>1845 — Papal States — $10,686,694<br>1845 — Baden — $448,000,000<br>1847 — Great Britain — $1,722,065,657<br>1847 — France — $1,236,885,967<br>1847 — Hanover — $115,200,000<br>1848 — Baden — $80,000,000<br>1848 — Bavaria — $704,000,000<br>1848–51 — Hesse — $208,000,000</p><p name="68cc" id="68cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Total — ~$20,000,000,000</p><p name="e210" id="e210" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Due to the lack of consistent sources on inflation rates from the early 1900s, the calculation after converting all the currencies to modern USD leaves us with about $25 billion, yet the Encyclopedia’s own summation is given as $654,847,200 in 1906 USD, which today is about $20 billion; we therefore use the lower estimate to give the Rothschilds the benefit of the doubt. And yet, even giving them the benefit of the doubt, that leaves us with $20 billion in government funds originating from five bankers and their father. Each of these loans comes with its own stipulations, interest, etc., so that the family doing the loaning winds up in the end with more money than what was given out. And that is merely a period of thirty years, not even their thirty best years, and only the loans which they granted to governments; these do not include loans to businesses, banks, etc.</p><p name="e810" id="e810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such a massive quantity of today’s capital must be able to find their origins in these Rothschild loans, and therefore, such a massive amount of the world’s global economy was built from the ground-up on Rothschild terms and conditions. Naturally, this must have had some effect on politics. The Rothschilds became a sovereign power in their own right, standing above entire countries. In 1826, Britain was faced with a liquidity crisis; but the Rothschilds, through their connections to German coin minting, produced enough gold for the British Government to stay afloat. In America, the Second Bank of the United States — the country’s central bank — grew massively through the investments of James Mayer Rothschild. The modern US Treasury also comes from the Rothschilds too — J.P. Morgan and the Rothschild &amp; Co. Bank loaned 3.5 million ounces of gold (about $66 million in today’s money) to the US Treasury in 1895 to prevent its bankruptcy, meaning the modern US Treasury, thus the modern US government itself (since one must remember, a state is no more than the political superstructure of an economy), was built on the demands of Rothschild-Morgan. It feels apt, then, to quote what a certain Joseph Stalin observed from the other side of the world:</p><blockquote name="a624" id="a624" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Under capitalism the masses do not, nor can they ever, really participate in governing their country. Even under the most democratic capitalistic regime, governments are not set up by the people but by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and the Morgans. (12)</blockquote><p name="5f00" id="5f00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">By the turn of the 20th century, forty-one palaces had been built in the Rothschilds’ name, in countries ranging from France to America. They still reside in these palaces today, secluded from the general population, as if the longing for the ghetto has not yet faded from their souls.</p><p name="e312" id="e312" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1919, the Rothschilds and a few others — Scotia Bank, Societe Generale, and the Deutsche Bank, all of which have further connections to the Rothschilds — began the “tradition” of “gold fixing”, i.e. getting together in a room to set the price of the world’s gold each day. BBC says:</p><blockquote name="d065" id="d065" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Every day at 10:30 and 15:00 local time, five representatives of investment banks meet in a small room at Rothschild’s London headquarters on St Swithin’s Lane. They are charged by the London Gold Market to agree a price for the bullion on offer. Each sits behind a desk and gets a phone and small Union Jack. In the centre is the chairperson, who for the past 85 years has come from Rothschild. A price is given and relayed via phone lines to customers.</blockquote><blockquote name="ebb6" id="ebb6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Then the haggling begins. When the price is right and buyers are matched with sellers, the flags are lowered and the price is fixed. (13)</blockquote><p name="c55b" id="c55b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So, the Rothschilds own more than wealth — they own the worth of wealth itself. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, various countries issued decrees requiring citizens to turn in their gold in exchange for paper money — at the start of the 1930s, gold was worth about $20/oz. By 1933, it had reached $35/oz. By 1980, $865.35/oz. Today, $1,783.00/oz.</p><p name="046a" id="046a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Rothschilds “withdrew” from gold fixing in 2004 and only occasionally attend by telephone. Instead, it is all their subsidiary banks which carry out the fixing. The banks in charge of this process today are: the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Coins ‘N Things, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, INTL FCStone, Jane Street Global Trading, HSBC Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase, Koch Supply and Trading, Marex Financial, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Toronto-Dominion Bank. The Rothschild Investment Trust, owned by the head of the family, Jacob Rothschild, owns about 168,400 shares in JPMorgan Chase and 4,800 in Morgan Stanley. (14) One can only guess what further “connections” they have beyond the public’s eyes, connections through this or that charity, through this or that Masonic Lodge.</p><p name="303c" id="303c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is no more than an act of self-assurance to say that the influence of Rothschild capital has simply vanished without a trace, as many are apt to assert. The Rothschilds, realistically, should still have a massive amount of economic and political influence today, even if their overall wealth appears to have decreased: for every dollar lost, a bit of social influence was won. We must understand this dynamic thoroughly before moving on to their political influence.</p><h4 name="defa" id="defa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">HOW A FAMILY CAN OWN THE WORLD</h4><p name="1238" id="1238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To understand the way in which the Rothschilds have cast a net over the world’s markets, we must understand some general principles about the way in which finance capital operates, its tendency to bring vast sums of wealth and production under the very centralized control of a few individuals. Liberals are today quick to assure that the Rothschilds are “only” worth about $250 billion put together, and the richest of them — Jacob Rothschild — is only worth about $5 or $6 billion. Thus, they assert, the Rothschilds were once great and powerful, but today have mostly faded into irrelevancy, supplanted by the larger names like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and so on.</p><p name="b2ea" id="b2ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us consider: the largest bank in the world today, JP Morgan Chase, has about $2 trillion in total direct assets. It is owned by one Chief Executive — Jamie Dimon. Dimon’s net worth is $1 billion.</p><p name="e329" id="e329" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, $1 billion controls $2 trillion.</p><p name="9cd1" id="9cd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The underlying principle to this goes as follows: under the “investment holding” system that has existed since the dawn of global capitalism, one may purchase “shares” in a company, and those shares correspond to votes in the company’s directing board. If one owns 50.01% of a company, they therefore control 100% of the company, because to control 50.01% of the votes is to hold the majority even if everybody else votes against you. So, an individual must only invest, for example, $1,000 to entirely control a company worth $2,000 — thus, under this system, $1,000 is worth $2,000. And so, with that company worth $2,000, they theoretically possess enough capital to purchase 50% of the shares in a company worth $4,000. Thus, $1,000 owns $8,000, and so on.</p><p name="e833" id="e833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Exact amounts vary, and companies of course can’t spend their entire capital to purchase another company, so time must pass in each case for capital to generate new wealth before the “old wealth” may be invested. There are also of course the regulations and rules of this or that state, but as we will see, this matters little. The acquisition unstoppably happens in some way or another. The “nominal” wealth of somebody is completely meaningless — it is a matter of who invests the largest amount at the earliest time.</p><p name="c0c8" id="c0c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that in mind, one should be inclined to think that the Rothschilds are richer today than they were in the 1800s, regardless of the comparatively little nominal wealth, because all capital is in some way tied to them and their original banking projects, including nearly every government treasury in Europe and in the United States (as we have already seen). Their wealth has not disappeared, it has simply transformed. It must be considered not as loose change, but as capital, as a social relation. The social and political influence of the Rothschilds is predicated on one primary fact: their bank, AM Rothschild &amp; Sons, was the first international bank, and therefore nearly all other global financial institutions of the world have evolved out of Rothschild capital, on the Rothschilds’ “terms and conditions”. Today, Rothschild &amp; Co. has “only” $80 billion under direct management, and this is seemingly not much compared to some of the huge global banks: JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, hold about $3.2 trillion, $2.3 trillion, $1.7 trillion, and $1.6 trillion, respectively. But even the oldest of these, Wells Fargo, was not founded until 1852, 86 years after the founding of the original AM Rothschild &amp; Sons in 1766. BNP Paribas, the largest bank in France, was founded in 1848 through a state loan — just a year prior, the Rothschilds had given a loan today worth $1.2 billion to the French government. HSBC Holdings, the largest bank in Britain and the sixth largest in the world, was created in 1865 by the Legislature of Hong Kong only a few years after Lionel Rothschild had loaned an amount worth $2.2 billion to the British government.</p><p name="ad91" id="ad91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any banks which did not emerge under the Rothschilds were quickly subordinated by them and brought under the global monopoly. Even the massive Chinese banks of the modern age, which are ostensibly protected by a thousand layers of state protection, find themselves unable to resist Rothschild money. The influence is so felt that even the official state broadcasting station CGTN, speaks of “China’s fascination with the Rothschild family”:</p><p name="6638" id="6638" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In recent decades more and more Chinese economists and budding entrepreneurs have closely studied the Rothschilds. At the same time, members of the Rothschild family have looked to a rising China for new business opportunities. In fact, the Rothschild family came to China as long ago as the 1830s, when it set up a small gold and silver trading business in Shanghai. In 1953, four years after the founding of New China, Rothschild was one of the first major Western banks to establish relations with the country.

But the principle applies no matter how many companies the wealth is split among: for instance, take $10. With that $10, one could invest $1 in ten $2 companies, and thus own them entirely, or they could invest $5 in two $10 companies, and thus own them entirely. In both cases, $10 is controlling $20. It does not matter how many separate companies the process splits into, the general principle stays the same. What matters most here is time, who is first and quickest to seize upon newly sprung businesses and bring them under the arm of their own monopolies. The first was undoubtedly Rothschild &amp; Co., which was already handling massive transactions and loans with the major states of Europe by 1810.</p><p name="b75d" id="b75d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us take a moment to remind ourselves how Niall Ferguson, the American historian for the Hoover Institution at Harvard (who in 2003 proudly called himself a “fully paid-up member of the neo-imperialist gang” for his support of the Iraq War), writes of the NM Rothschild &amp; Co. Bank in his work The House of Rothschild: The World’s Banker:</p><blockquote name="f6a1" id="f6a1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">For most of the nineteenth century, N M Rothschild was part of the biggest bank in the world which dominated the international bond market. For a contemporary equivalent, one has to imagine a merger between Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and probably Goldman Sachs too — as well, perhaps, as the International Monetary Fund, given the nineteenth-century Rothschild’s role in stabilizing the finances of numerous governments. (16)</blockquote><p name="316a" id="316a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That is what even the “fully paid-up members” of cosmopolitan finance admit frankly. We must then ask ourselves: if NM Rothschild &amp; Co. was “the biggest bank in the world, dominating the international market, for “most of the nineteenth century”, can we not say that all the other banks mentioned may trace their wealth directly to the Rothschilds, to their coin-minting and money-lending? One can be sure that the Rothschilds would openly claim they created the modern world if the modern world was something to be proud of.</p><p name="1a14" id="1a14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today’s Rothschild Investment Trust (RIT) currently owns about 46,500 shares in Wells Fargo, and a further 168,400 in JPMorgan Chase, 166,700 in Bank of America, and 11,100 in Citigroup (14). They have capital in other financial institutions as well: 1,340,000 in Alps/Westport Resources Hedged High Income Fund, 813,300 in Annaly Capital Management Inc., 141,400 shares in Bitcoin, and so on (Ibid). RIT’s owner, Jacob Rothschild, also brought to close the age old “rivalry” between the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers when they announced in 2012 that RIT was purchasing 37% of the Rockefeller Family Trust (17). The Rothschilds also own 134,000 shares in Chevron and 51,100 in ExxonMobil, the descendants of the long-defunct Rockefeller Standard Oil.</p><p name="2204" id="2204" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, there is also the Edmond de Rothschild Group, a conglomerate of various other financial institutions chaired by Benjamin Rothschild. It has about $188 billion in assets under management.</p><p name="7acb" id="7acb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The non-Rothschild billionaires of today, as well as their companies, originate from the Rothschilds too. Let us take Bill Gates, probably the best known cosmopolitan monopolist and the third richest man in the world. He is known for his “philanthropy” schemes — his charity, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has donated some $50 billion of Gates’ own money to “charitable causes” over the years. Gates inherited some wealth from his father, but only grew into a real monopolist with the Microsoft Corporation. Forbes explains that this Corporation, according to Gates himself, would not exist today if it weren’t for the $350 million (today $834 million) investment made by Goldman-Sachs bank at Microsoft’s beginning. (18) So, according to Gates himself: no Goldman-Sachs, no Microsoft Corporation.</p><p name="fede" id="fede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, we simply must consider that Rothschild Investment Trust holds around 13,600 shares in Goldman-Sachs and 80,000 in the Microsoft Corporation (14), and that at the time of the loan, they were also determining the value of the very gold on which Goldman-Sachs’ wealth is based. So: Gates built his company on the terms of Goldman-Sachs, who were built on the terms of Rothschild.</p><p name="73d6" id="73d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is also in an “alliance” (in their words) with the Rockefeller Foundations (19), which itself is not only owned indirectly by the Rothschilds through the Rockefeller Family Trust, but also more directly through its former trustee Raymond Smith, the current Chairman of Rothschild Continuation Investments and former Chairman of N.M.

The British Member of Parliament Thomas Duncombe, a friend of Nathan Mayer, wrote:</p><blockquote name="9440" id="9440" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Master of unbounded wealth, Nathan Mayer Rothschild boasts that he is the arbiter of peace and war, and that the credit of nations depends upon his nod; his correspondents are innumerable; his courtiers outrun those of sovereign princes, and absolute sovereigns; ministers of state are in his pay. Para mount in the cabinets of continental Europe, he aspires to the domination of our own. (21)</blockquote><p name="9ab0" id="9ab0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That same friend would later help Nathan Mayer’s son, Lionel, become a Member of Parliament in 1848. From then until 1856, Lionel, Nathan, and Mayer Rothschild were all Members of Parliament in Britain, meaning 3 of the 658 seats belonged to the Rothschild family. In 1894, Mayer’s son-in-law Archibald Primrose was elected Prime Minister as well.</p><p name="2b78" id="2b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1821, war broke out between Portugal and their colony of Brazil, which had declared its independence. The Rothschild Archive says that after three years of fighting had transpired, the American company Samuel Philips &amp; Co. wrote to Rothschild &amp; Co. on 14 of August, 1824:</p><blockquote name="16d2" id="16d2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Your friends at the West End have the business in their hands to decide between Portugal &amp; Brazil &amp; an early intimation from you may serve us materially. (22)</blockquote><p name="1cba" id="1cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Twenty-four days later, the war had come to an end and the Empire of Brazil was victoriously proclaimed under the rule of Dom Pedro I, a Freemason — Freemasons funding Freemasons. The Archive says:</p><p name="1290" id="1290" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nathan Rothschild took an early interest in the new Brazilian state. The involvement of the Bank in Brazilian government finances dates virtually from the moment of Brazilian independence and came fully into force with British recognition of the new state in 1825. There is evidence in the Archive that as early as 1823, Nathan Rothschild was considering a loan with Samuel, Phillips &amp; Co. to the Brazilian government. (Ibid)</p><p name="9933" id="9933" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the half-decade before his death, Nathan Mayer would spend an amount worth $1.9 billion successfully abolishing the British slave trade, while around that same time in Austria, Salomon Mayer had been placed on the governing board of the Viennese Bank, the central bank of Austria, by Prince Klemens Metternich. When that same Metternich was overthrown by the Austrian Liberal Revolution in 1848, the events left us with a rather interesting glimpse into the “mind of the masses” in regards to the banker family at the time. Immediately after the revolution was published Ein offener Brief an Rothschild (An Open Letter to the Rothschilds), a work by some anonymous Polish nationalists. It reads:</p><blockquote name="ced6" id="ced6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">They are the strange ones. Changes of recent times, which reshaped all of Europe, are the doings of these great ones. [The Revolution was a] loss suffered by the House of Rothschild. Not that this loss had a significant impact on their general welfare or woe (for the Rothschilds never worked for the general best) but as a warning example for the great, who, in their proud arrogance, boast of defying fate, and with contempt and disdain for theirs look down at the masses from a deceptive height. One more fall of the House of Rothschild and it is in ashes…. (23)</blockquote><p name="7d28" id="7d28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Wishful thinking. The Rothschilds would actually become present evermore with the rise of global liberalism. The prospect of somehow combating global finance with the stately form of liberalism was (and still is) a sweet tale for liberals to soothe themselves. In Germany, liberalism was brought by the Rothschilds themselves. The German Friedrich Engels wrote in his 1852 work Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany:</p><p name="5a01" id="5a01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The financial difficulties of the Government went on increasing. There remained nothing but to try a loan. Rothchild was applied to, and he declared that if the loan was to be guaranteed by the mysterious “Representation of the People,” he would undertake the thing at a moment’s notice — if not, he could not have anything to do with the transaction.</p><p name="4b94" id="4b94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus every hope of obtaining money had vanished, and there was no possibility of escaping the fatal “Representation of the People.” Rothschild’s refusal was known in autumn, 1846, and in February of the next year the King called together all the eight Provincial Diets to Berlin, forming them into one “United Diet.”</p><p name="ce9d" id="ce9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Further worth note is that King Wilhelm IV’s son, Prince Wilhelm, was a Freemason, with Engel’s accomplice Marx once observing:</p><blockquote name="6835" id="6835" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">It is well known that the Prince of Prussia [Wilhelm] is the supreme head of the Prussian Freemasons, just as King Wilhelm IV is the supreme head of the Prussian religion. (24)</blockquote><p name="941d" id="941d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In 1854, Napoleon III, Emperor of France, appointed Alphonse Rothschild as one of the governors of France’s central bank, the Banque de France. That same Napoleon III led the country into war with the Prussians in 1870, and France was promptly crushed — the masses stood to lose the most out of anyone. Thus, it was the masses which arose in nationalistic fervor throughout 1871 to establish a Commune in Paris, opposed to the Thiers Government that had accepted the crippling Versailles Treaty with the Prussians. The Rothschilds ensured the destruction of this Commune at the hands of the Thiers Government in two ways.</p><p name="5f7e" id="5f7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, they employed explicit means — brute force. Britannica writes:</p><p name="0403" id="0403" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alphonse, as the head of the international banking syndicate that in 1871 and 1872 placed the two great French loans known as liberation loans after France’s defeat by Prussia, could boast without immodesty that his influence had maintained the chief of the French government, Adolphe Thiers, in power.</p><p name="e8db" id="e8db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Thiers Government would then massacre the Parisian uprising in the “Bloody Week”, marking the death of the Commune.</p><p name="f87b" id="f87b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, also crucial in the fall of the Commune was political discord sown among the masses. The Rothschilds had taken to intrigue, to secretive political means, through Freemasonry. The Masons infiltrated the International Workingmen’s Association, the ideological body believed to be responsible for the uprising, through the “Republican Alliance” — this organization, founded right then in 1871, was led by Leon Gambetta, a Mason from “The Reform” Lodge in Paris, and called for Jules Grevy from the “Constante Amitie” Mason Lodge in Arras to be appointed as President of France (25). This Alliance had not only infiltrated the International Workingmen’s Association, but the Commune itself.</p><p name="071e" id="071e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Masons also employed their agents to sow discord among the revolutionary intelligentsia. They spread idealistic fantasies which they had conceived from the depths of their lodges: whole swathes of the intelligentsia became proponents of “Anarchism”, an ideology represented by Mikhail Bakunin, a writer of Masonic propaganda from the Grand Orient de France (26).</p><p name="e316" id="e316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Workingman’s Association barely survived the fall of the Commune, and by 1872, it had split between the Communists — the supporters of the Commune — and the Anarchists, the Freemasons. Reflecting on this split, the aforementioned Marx, leader of the International Workingman’s Association, wrote:</p><blockquote name="b1e4" id="b1e4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Behind the International’s Geneva section was the Central Bureau of the secret Republican Alliance. Relying on this Freemasonry, whose existence was suspected neither by the mass of the International’s membership nor by their administrative centres, Bakunin hoped to win control of the International. (27)</blockquote><p name="5f88" id="5f88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But enough of the Thiers Government and Paris. World politics moved on: Ferdinand Rothschild (a member of the UK Parliament and a Freemason) had the honor of meeting the Shah of Persia, Queen Victoria, and Friedrich I of Germany, all at the same banquet in 1890. In 1902, Nathan Rothschild (2) was knighted by Queen Victoria. In the period of 1911–1914, there arose fierce competition between the predecessor to BP, Europaische Petroleum Union (a cartel between Rothschild &amp; Nobel, Deutsche Bank, and Dutch Royal Shell — which itself had just bought the Russian oilfields from the Rothschilds), and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil over the limited oilfields in Romania. This competition had major implications in the lead-up to WWI, an event that again sees the Rothschilds being accused of having “played both sides”.</p><p name="62cf" id="62cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rothschild influence would persist in the period of 1918–1950, but we will not yet get into that. We will for now skip to 1964, where the still-living Jacob Rothschild marked his dedication to global integration by meeting the Freemason (28) Martin Luther King and hosting a banquet to celebrate King’s recently awarded Nobel Peace Prize (29). The Rothschilds also participated in various Bilderberg Meetings through Edmond Adolphe Rothschild (who died fairly recently in 1997). The Bilderberg Meeting (or Bilderberg Group) is an annual conference founded in 1954 which hosts political leaders, prominent businessmen, nobility, etc. to discuss politics, social issues, and so on. It was created by the Freemason Josef Retinger (who the Bilderberg Group for some reason describes as “a useless father and terrible husband” on their website) (30) with help from the CIA Director Walter Smith. The first Chairman of the Group was Prince Bernhard von Lippe-Biesterfeld, a former Nazi Party member.</p><p name="2bbd" id="2bbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is how Bilderberg describes Retinger’s political intentions:</p><blockquote name="ac8b" id="ac8b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Between 1906 and 1920, Retinger worked on projects as diverse as the definition of a reorganization plan for Central and Eastern Europe wanted by the Jesuits, the creation of a world government with the British federalist Arthur Capel, and the creation of the state of Israel in collaboration with some of the leaders of the Zionist movement, such as Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolov. (Ibid)</blockquote><blockquote name="56c3" id="56c3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">That Chaim Weizmann was the first President of Israel, and also a friend of the Rothschilds, having met three: Dorothy, Charles, and Edmond James (who we will discuss later). According to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, Weizmann also had ties to the Freemasons, having once been honored with a testimonial dinner attended by 150 Master Masons, who spoke in his favor (31).</blockquote><p name="3ec5" id="3ec5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But that is just Retinger and Weizmann. This is how Bilderberg describes the actual organization itself:</p><blockquote name="f5ef" id="f5ef" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The annual Bilderberg Meeting has been a forum for informal discussions to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. Every year, approx. 130 political leaders and experts from industry, finance, labour, academia and the media are invited to take part in the Meeting. The Meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor of any other participant may be revealed. Thanks to the private nature of the Meeting, the participants take part as individuals rather than in any official capacity, and hence are not bound by the conventions of their office or by pre-agreed positions. (32)</blockquote><p name="ec48" id="ec48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In the period of 1968 to 1977, Edmond Adolphe Rothschild attended every year’s Bilderberg Meeting, as did David Rockefeller (who continued to attend them until his death in 2011). During this time, Rockefeller founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973 with the Polish Freemason Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Senator Barry Goldwater, a member of the Commission, wrote in his 1979 book With No Apologies:</p><blockquote name="129e" id="129e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In my view, the Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize, control, and consolidate the four centers of power — political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical…. What the Trilaterals truly intend is the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political government of the nation-states involved. (33)</blockquote><p name="5d29" id="5d29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He also wrote of Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations:</p><blockquote name="15a7" id="15a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The CFR is the American branch of a society which originated in England. Internationalist in viewpoint, the CFR, along with the Atlantic Union Movement and the Atlantic Council of the United States, believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one-world rule established. (Ibid)</blockquote><p name="c0e9" id="c0e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Responding to these claims in general, Rockefeller wrote in Memoirs:</p><blockquote name="6ea6" id="6ea6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national self-determination practiced in past centuries. (34)</blockquote><p name="21dd" id="21dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Reflecting on his relationship with the Rothschilds, he said in 2012:</p><blockquote name="8e19" id="8e19" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Lord Rothschild and I have known each other for five decades.

(35)</blockquote><p name="9ae3" id="9ae3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And further, the foremost donor of the Democratic Party in the United States (having run for President just recently) Michael Bloomberg said in 2015:</p><blockquote name="a386" id="a386" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If only my father knew that I know David Rockefeller and Jacob Rothschild, he would be so proud. (36)</blockquote><p name="b0db" id="b0db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Such are the political connections and motivations of the pair attending the secretive Bilderberg Meetings.</p><p name="4f67" id="4f67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1968, Rothschild-Rockefeller were joined at the Meeting by Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau and the monopolist Henry Ford II; in 1970, they had the honor of meeting Prime Minister of the UK Edward Heath; in 1971 they enjoyed the company of US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has gone on to attend nearly every meeting since then, including the most recent one in 2019 (and who has much further ties to the Rothschilds-Rockefellers that we will not get into here); in 1973, they were joined by a whole host of important monopolists, including Gerrit Wagner (CEO of Shell company), Sir Eric Drake (CEO of British Petroleum), Wilfrid Baumgartner (Governor of the Bank of France), Robert O. Anderson (the largest landowner in the US at the time), Anders Bjorgerd (CEO of Sydkraft AB, Sweden’s largest oil company), Arthur Dean (partner at law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell where he worked with John Foster Dulles, the former US Secretary of State and brother of Allen Dulles, the first CIA Director), Joseph Luns (the ex-Secretary General of NATO), and more. According to Bilderberg’s own report (37), they discussed a prospective spike in global oil prices and the way in which that could affect profits. A few months after the meeting, the Yom Kippur War broke out between the Arabs and Israel, culminating in a Saudi embargo on foreign oil. Naturally, this led to a consequent spike in prices: oil was (nominally) $3 per barrel globally at the beginning of 1973, and by the end of the year had reached $12 per barrel (an increase of 400%). By 1981, oil was $37 per barrel (1,233%). From 1985 to 2001, it slowly declined before dropping to $17.90 per barrel in 2001. Luckily, the Iraq War subsequently broke out, and by 2008 oil had again shot up to $139.83 per barrel.</p><p name="1331" id="1331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 1978 Meeting was the last Edmond attended, but the close contacts and subsidiaries of the Rothschilds still attend today: Lawrence Summers, one of the eight directors of Genie Energy along with Rupert Murdoch, Dick Cheney, Jacob Rothschild, and others, attended Bilderberg in 2008. Jacob is also still personal friends with one of Bilderberg’s highest-attending members, Henry Kissinger, having met with him at the US Library of Congress in 2003; Lynn Rothschild met with him in 2006 (38); that same Lynn is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and she was on Bill Clinton’s National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council from 1993–1995, and on his Energy Advisory Committee from 1998–2000.</p><p name="a03a" id="a03a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Goldman-Sachs executive António Borges also attends the Bilderberg Meeting, while the Rothschild Investment Trust currently holds around 18,000 shares in Goldman-Sachs.</p><p name="dc82" id="dc82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside of the Bilderberg Group, the “Conservative” Prime Minister of the UK Margaret Thatcher and the “Socialist” President of France Francois Mitterrand showed just how much those labels mean when they met together in Jacob Rothschild’s house in 1990 (39).

According to the Archives:</p><p name="8223" id="8223" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 1830s, Nathan’s youngest son, Mayer went to Cambridge, establishing a long connection with that university. In Frankfurt. Hannah Mathilde von Rothschild supported the founding of the University of Frankfurt in 1912, with an exceptional sum of 500,000 Reichsmarks [about $80 million, to the best of my summation]. In 1992, the Rothschild family helped found the Rothschild Visiting Professorship programme at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge, and in 1998, as part of the bicentenary celebrations, the NM Rothschild &amp; Sons Professorship of Mathematical Sciences chair was endowed at the Mathematics Faculty and a separate charitable trust was created to commemorate the life of Victor Rothschild — a Cambridge scholar with close associations to the University. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (b.1931) has also been closely involved with the University of Buckingham since its creation, and in 1996, Her Majesty the Queen opened the Anthony de Rothschild Building at the University, which houses the school of business.</p><p name="515b" id="515b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The University of Frankfurt, the Isaac Newton Institute for Math at Cambridge (there is also an Isaac Newton Freemason Lodge at Cambridge, for that matter), the University of Buckingham… The Archives also say that Nathan Mayer helped create the Rhodes Scholarship at the University of Oxford (which also has a Freemason lodge) with the mastermind of Britain’s colonial policy, Cecil Rhodes.</p><p name="b4d8" id="b4d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, Emma Rothschild is a Professor at the Department of History at Harvard, a member of the Masonic “American Philosophical Society”, and an honorary fellow of both Cambridge and Oxford Universities, all while being a trustee of the Rothschild Archive we keep on referencing (42).

A Rothschild was the first Jew to enter the British Parliament, and another was the first to be elevated to the British peerage. The head of the British branch of the family has always been considered the unofficial head of British Jewry.</p><p name="7135" id="7135" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Rothschilds are “the head of the British Jewry” — so says Encyclopedia Britannica. The Jewish Encyclopedia adds:</p><p name="e82f" id="e82f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1885 Nathan Rothschild was raised to the peerage, and, as Baron Rothschild, was the first Jew to take his seat in the House of Lords, an event which was regarded as completing the emancipation of the English Jews.</p><p name="62e0" id="62e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And according to the Rothschild Archive:</p><blockquote name="37a4" id="37a4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Brought up in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt, Nathan [Mayer] and his brothers were imbued with a strong sense of the tradition of Zedaka, which places expectations on members of the community to work for social justice by offering material support for those in need. As the family’s wealth and influence grew, so did their commitment to this principle, along with their ability to apply it in more ambitious ways. While the word is used interchangeably for charity, ‘zedaka’ or ‘tzedakah’ is seen as a form of social justice provided by the donor as well as those who utilise the support to do their work and those who allow the support into their lives. As is the case with justice, this social responsibility cannot be done to someone, rather, it must be done with someone. So much more than a financial transaction, philanthropy in the spirit of zedakah builds trusting relationships and recognizes contributions of time, effort, and insight.</blockquote><p name="c325" id="c325" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The entire family preferred to become wholeheartedly involved in their favourite philanthropic interests, rather than simply making random payments to worthy causes… Education and support for young people is an enduring aspect of Rothschild family philanthropy.

But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. He will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Utterly abhor and detest it, for it is set apart for destruction. (Deuteronomy 7)</blockquote><p name="07d8" id="07d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Rothschilds, believing in this religion, also believe in these principles, and act on them accordingly. The Rothschild Archive says:</p><p name="d543" id="d543" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Israel owes many of its early economic successes to the work of Edmond de Rothschild, who founded numerous colonies for Jewish settlers. A silk factory, vineyard and flour mill, as well as the introduction of crops such as grapefruit and avocado, enabled the settlers to establish their economic independence.</p><p name="37a8" id="37a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The former President of Israel, Yitzhak Navon, agrees. He said in 1982:</p><blockquote name="a090" id="a090" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">It is difficult to imagine this important chapter in our history without Karl Netter, Adolphe Cremieux, Edmond de Rothschild and the Alliance Israelite Universelle. (46)</blockquote><p name="e830" id="e830" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let us look into those three men.</p><p name="1691" id="1691" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adolph Cremieux was the founder of the Alliance Israelite Universelle in 1860, a French Zionist organization that partook in a “civilizing mission” teaching French and Judaism across the lands of Algeria, Palestine, Egypt, and so on. Cremieux, on top of being a Zionist, was a Freemason of the “Bienfait Anonyme” Lodge in the Grand Orient de France. (47)</p><p name="c6b5" id="c6b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Karl Netter was the founder of Mikveh Israel, the first Jewish settlement in the land of Palestine. He was serving as the General Secretary of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and received funds from them to create the settlement. Netter also founded the first Freemason lodge of Israel, the “Royal Solomon Mother Lodge” in 1873, just three years after founding Mikveh Israel itself. (48)</p><p name="ef22" id="ef22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Edmond James de Rothschild was the one who provided the necessary funds for the other two. We must study him in slightly more detail: he was an ardent Zionist, born in 1845 to James Mayer and James Mayer’s niece, Betty. He had served in the French National Guard in 1870, that is to say, he was among the army that suppressed the Paris Commune. In 1882, he purchased swathes of Palestine to create Rishon LeZion and Zichron Ja’akov, continuing to buy Arab territory before donating more than 60,000 acres to the Jewish Colonization Association in 1899, along with about a sum today worth about $48 billion. The Jewish Colonization Association used this money well: between 1900 and 1903, they created five new settlements, and according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, they further made colonies in the United States territories of New Jersey, Connecticut, etc., as well as some in Canada, Argentina, and Turkey for good measure.</p><p name="1d59" id="1d59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The modern Zionist movement truly began around that time, with Theodor Herzl’s 1896 work Address to the Rothschilds, now known as The Jewish State. Whereas the Rothschilds founded the practical Zionist settlements, it was Herzl who founded Zionist ideology. For his role, his remains today lie in Mount Herzl, Israel, and the country celebrates an annual Herzl Day to honor the “formulation of the State of Israel in accordance with his Zionist vision”. The Declaration of the State of Israel was given under his portrait, and a similar portrait still hangs in the Israeli Knesset (Parliament). In 2018, the World Jewish Congress — which is led by David Rothschild, owner of Rothschild &amp; Co. — held a Herzl Awards Dinner which was attended by not only David, but Jacob Rothschild as well. (49)</p><p name="92ff" id="92ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Herzl’s work is what we intend to focus on. The reader is highly recommended to look at it. It describes the Zionist plan in full detail, including their intention to secure funding primarily from rich Jewish bankers:</p><blockquote name="4678" id="4678" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The first method of raising capital is through big banks. The required sum could then be raised in the shortest possible time among the large financial groups, after they had discussed the advisability of the course.</blockquote><blockquote name="e90e" id="e90e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Many latent political forces lie in our financial power, that power which our enemies assert to be so effective. The credit of our great Jewish financiers would have to be placed at the service of the National Idea. The realization of this plan will afford an opportunity for drawing a clear line of distinction between them and the rest of Jewry.</blockquote><blockquote name="a3da" id="a3da" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The great financiers, moreover, will certainly not be asked to raise an amount so enormous out of pure philanthropic motives; that would be expecting too much. The promoters and stock holders of the Jewish Company are, on the contrary, expected to do a good piece of business.</blockquote><blockquote name="b197" id="b197" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Rich Jews who are now obliged carefully to hide their valuables, and to hold their dreary banquets behind lowered curtains, will be able to enjoy their possessions in peace “over there.” If they cooperate in carrying out this emigration scheme, their capital will be rehabilitated. (50)</blockquote><p name="b0c6" id="b0c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He further describes his plan to infiltrate the Synagogues, the same ones built by Rothschilds:</p><blockquote name="dcef" id="dcef" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Our Rabbis, on whom we especially call, will devote their energies to the service of our idea, and will inspire their congregations by preaching it from the pulpit. They will not need to address special meetings for the purpose; an appeal such as this may be uttered in the synagogue. And thus it must be done. For we feel our historic affinity only through the faith of our fathers. The Rabbis will receive communications regularly from both Society and Company, and will announce and explain these to their congregations. Israel will pray for us and for itself. (Ibid)</blockquote><p name="7962" id="7962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Further, Herzl describes how the main purpose of his Zionist project is entirely to prevent the inevitable assimilation of Jews — in other words, it is to recreate the ghetto that had been broken apart by the rise of global capitalism. He says:</p><blockquote name="166b" id="166b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Assimilation of Jews could be effected only by intermarriage. But… I do not for a moment wish to imply that I desire assimilation. Our national character is too historically famous, and, in spite of every degradation, too fine to make its annihilation desirable. (Ibid)</blockquote><p name="28b9" id="28b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In 1897, Herzl founded the World Zionist Congress at a casino in Basel, Switzerland, to carry out his hypothetical settlement project — it was the body out of which the State of Israel itself grew. Herzl acknowledged:</p><blockquote name="6578" id="6578" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If I were to sum up the Basel Congress in a single phrase I would say: In Basel I created the Jewish State. Were I to say this aloud I would be greeted by universal laughter. But perhaps five years hence, in any case, certainly fifty years hence, everyone will perceive it. (Ibid)</blockquote><p name="cd1f" id="cd1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Congress functioned as a sovereign state (and was recognized as such by the countries of Europe), with its members convening yearly from across the world to decide on the course of settlement projects. Herzl wrote in The Jewish State:</p><blockquote name="4667" id="4667" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Those Jews who agree with our idea of a State will attach themselves to the Society, which will thereby be authorized to confer and treat with Governments in the name of our people. The Society will thus be acknowledged in its relations with Governments as a State-creating power. This acknowledgment will practically create the State. Should the Powers declare themselves willing to admit our sovereignty over a neutral piece of land, then the Society will enter into negotiations for the possession of this land. (Ibid)</blockquote><p name="8147" id="8147" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Sitting to Herzl’s left at this First Zionist Congress was the Hungarian Zionist Max Nordau. The Jewish Encyclopedia says:</p><blockquote name="b44a" id="b44a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">When Herzl started the Zionistic movement Nordau was one of those who most quickly and ardently responded; and these two at once came to be looked upon as the natural leaders of the movement. Herzl was elected president of the Congress and Nordau first vice-president without question. Nordau delivered an address on “Die Allgemeine Lage der Juden”, which thrilled the world. (51)</blockquote><p name="f824" id="f824" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let us take a look at the address he gave that “thrilled the world”, Die Allgemeine Lage der Juden:</p><blockquote name="8184" id="8184" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">More industrious and more able than the average European, not to speak at all of the inert Asian and African, the Jew is being condemned to poverty. One complains of Jews intruding everywhere, but they only strive after superiority because they do not have equality. The governments and peoples should pause before they convert the Jews into a dangerous element. (52)</blockquote><p name="ca53" id="ca53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Congress had an effect on the Rothschilds. According to the American Zionist Emergency Council, “Lord Albert Rothschild seemed to be won over by Herzl” and “the old banker visited him in his hotel” (50). That was the dynamic: the “head of the English Jewry” and the “creator of the Jewish State” lounging in hotels and discussing world settlement. He would go on to meet Edmond de Rothschild as well.</p><p name="995f" id="995f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By 1917, the project was in full swing, as marked by the famous (or infamous) Balfour Declaration: the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote to the Member of Parliament, Walter Rothschild, formally announcing British governmental support for the creation of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. Reflecting on this event, Jacob Rothschild said:</p><p name="9619" id="9619" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How did this miracle happen? You had an impoverished would-be scientist, Chaim Weizmann, who somehow gets to England, meets a few people, including members of my family, and charms them. He gets to Balfour, and he unbelievably persuades Balfour, and Lloyd-George, the Prime Minister, that this idea of a national home for Jews should be allowed to take place. I mean, it’s so unlikely. This is perhaps the greatest event in Jewish life for thousands of years, and it’s a miracle that it took place.</p><p name="d3da" id="d3da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Addressing concerns as to what this “miracle” could lead to, Secretary Balfour wrote in 1922:</p><blockquote name="c05f" id="c05f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, future hopes far profounder than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land. (53)</blockquote><p name="41b8" id="41b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Meanwhile, Edmond James continued his work: he created his own Palestine Jewish Colonization Association in 1924, through which he purchased 123,552 acres for the settlement of Jews in the Middle East. After his death in 1934, he was buried in Paris, but he was later exhumed and transferred to his settlement of Zichron Ja’akov after the founding of Israel, where the first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion gave a speech in his honor.</p><p name="b935" id="b935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, we arrive upon the 1930s and 40s, the rise of the Nazis and Fascism in Europe. It is here that some perhaps controversial facts — but facts nonetheless — must be acknowledged.</p><p name="1837" id="1837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First is that, in the entire rise of the Nazis and Fascists, in the entire course of WWII, there was only one Rothschild who died — Élisabeth de Rothschild — and it was by disease after she had been arrested for illegally crossing the French border. All Rothschilds were allowed to peacefully depart to Britain, America, etc. when Europe fell to the Nazis. Further, the Society for Jewish Poor in Germany was allowed to continue operating until 1940, eight years after the Nazis had taken power, before it was finally shut down.</p><p name="6d04" id="6d04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second is a subject which will require delicate care. We are familiar with the statistic that six million Jews died in the Holocaust. Six million died, this is true, and nobody can deny it — but one is pressed to ask, by what definition were they “Jewish”? A Jew is someone who believes in the Jewish religion. The only other interpretation — that Jews are an Ancient Semitic people set apart by their Jewish blood — is the interpretation employed by the Nazis. With that in mind, we must consider some facts.</p><blockquote name="d7ed" id="d7ed" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">How many Jews were in Germany prior to the Holocaust? According to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, the total population of Jews in 1932 amounted to 523,000 (out of 67 million Germans). (54)</blockquote><blockquote name="eda1" id="eda1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">In 1932, 37,000 left Germany for other countries, primarily the US. From 1932 to 1939, about 60,000 Jews left Germany for Palestine. This was done through the infamous Havaara Agreement, signed between the Zionist Federation of Germany and the Nazi Party, employing the use of the Anglo-Palestine Bank founded by the World Zionist Congress. (55)</blockquote><p name="8c4f" id="8c4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Holocaust Memorial Museum says that by the time the Holocaust began, 282,000 of the 505,000 German Jews had departed Germany (56). This leaves us with 223,000 Jews in Germany at the start of the Holocaust.</p><p name="0187" id="0187" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of those, 150,000 served in the Wehrmacht (57), leaving us with 73,000 Jews — in other words, twice as many German Jews perpetuated the Holocaust than perished in it. Even if every one of those 73,000 Jews perished (they did not), it begs the question: how did six million Jews die?</p><p name="b50e" id="b50e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to the World Jewish Congress:</p><blockquote name="b622" id="b622" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Germany’s racial laws identified a “Jew” as anyone with three or more Jewish grandparents, regardless of their religious identity or practice. Conversions to Christianity were pronounced illegitimate going back two generations, formalizing and instituting Nazi racial theories. (58)</blockquote><p name="73d0" id="73d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Thus, the six million people who died were only Jews if one subscribes to Nazi racial science, and if one condones and accepts the revocation of Jews’ citizenship by the Nazis.</p><p name="d3b4" id="d3b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, this brings us to the harsher facts about the role of actual, practicing Jews in the Holocaust. Herzl wrote in The Jewish State:</p><blockquote name="e891" id="e891" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Governments of all countries scourged by Anti-Semitism will be keenly interested in assisting us to obtain the sovereignty we want. Anti-Semites provide the requisite impetus. They need only do what they did before, and then they will create a desire to emigrate where it did not previously exist, and strengthen it where it existed before. I imagine that Governments will, either voluntarily or under pressure from the Anti-Semites, pay certain attention to this scheme, and they may perhaps actually receive it here and there with a sympathy which they will also show to the Society of Jews… A great period of prosperity would commence in countries which are now Anti-Semitic.</blockquote><p name="8a2e" id="8a2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Thus, it follows: in the infamous Ghettos of Warsaw, Vilna, etc., the racially-classified “Jews” were kept under control by actual religiously practicing Jews through the Judenpolezei (Jewish-Police). These policemen bore the Zionist flag Herzl had created (the prototype of today’s flag of Israel) on their armbands, and placed the gold Star of David on the shirts of their countrymen. They assisted in rounding up and beating the assimilated Jews of the occupied countries in preparation for the Holocaust. In the course of the war, Jewish collaborators were employed through the Judenraaten (Jewish-Council). In Palestine, the Jewish terrorist group Lehi kept close contact with the Nazi government and the Italian Fascists as well. The German Admiral Ralf von der Marwitz filed the “Ankara Report” stating Lehi would “actively take part in the war on Germany’s side” in return for Germany’s recognition of a “historic Jewish state on a national and totalitarian basis, bound by a treaty with the German Reich”. When the Holocaust commenced, the camp guards appointed unassimilated Jews to the Funktionshäftling (prisoner-functionary), the “Kapos”, to assist in managing forced labor and so forth. And most importantly, as if echoing Herzl’s directions verbatim, it was written in the “Final Solution” devised by the Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich:</p><blockquote name="3c60" id="3c60" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The essential point is the expulsion of the Jews from the living space of the German people. In carrying out these efforts, an increased and planned acceleration of the emigration of the Jews from Reich territory was started, as the only possible present solution. The Jews themselves, or their Jewish political organizations, financed the emigration. In order to avoid impoverished Jews’ remaining behind, the principle was followed that wealthy Jews have to finance the emigration of poor Jews. (59)</blockquote><p name="b3cb" id="b3cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What follows? Exactly as Herzl said: only four years after the end of the war, with the narrative of the slaughter of the “Jews” fresh in people’s minds, the State of Israel was proclaimed. The four men who played a major role in this declaration and subsequent United Nations recognition were:</p><p name="1db9" id="1db9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Harry Truman, the President of the United States. He was also a Shriner Freemason, a member of the Belton Masonic Lodge. He founded the Grandview Masonic Lodge, where he served as Master, and while serving as a Senator, he was appointed Grandmaster of the Missouri Grand Lodge. In 1945, just four years prior to helping found Israel, he was appointed Sovereign Grand Inspector of the Masonic Supreme Council Southern Jurisdiction in Washington D.C. All of this information comes from the US Congress itself. (60)</p><p name="ca27" id="ca27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was also a member of the Studholme Masonic Lodge, according to Business Insider. (61)</p><p name="d71c" id="d71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chaim Weizmann, the First President of Israel. As we have already said, Weizmann was given a testimonial dinner by 150 Master Masons, according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency. (31)</p><p name="2208" id="2208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Israel Brodie, the Chief Rabbi of Britain who was appointed through the United Synagogue that had been created by Nathan Mayer a century prior. Brodie was a Grand Chaplain of the Masonic United Grand Lodge of England (62).</p><p name="d4c9" id="d4c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For what it’s worth, the World War itself was Masons against Masons: not only were Churchill and Truman Masons, but Franklin Roosevelt as well — he was a member of Architect Lodge, №519 (as were his sons), and he was a Grand Master in the Order of DeMolay (a Masonic youth group) (64). Meanwhile, the Italian Fascists were no different — Gabriele d’Annunzio (the founder of the Fascist ideology), Achille Starace (the Secretary of the Fascist Party), and Francesco Giunta (Starace’s successor), among many others, were Masons, and in the case of the Nazis, the National Socialist Party itself was created out of a merger of various organizations, most prominently the Thule Society, a Masonic organization created by the Freemason and aristocrat Rudolf von Sebottendorf (63). The “Aryanism” of the Nazis, too, was based on the “Theozoology” of von Sebottendorf’s ally, George von Liebenfels, who derived his ideology from Helen Blavatsky’s Masonic (among other things) “Theosophy”. We will not get into those ties in detail here, but I have done so in Freemasonry: The World-Historic Cartel, if the reader is curious.</p><p name="0399" id="0399" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems that all important leaders in the time of WWII, with the exception of a few, were Masons. Thus, the Zionists, Nazis, Fascists, and Western leaders in general, find their political ideas at least slightly affected by Masonry. Masonry, in turn, is dominated by the immensely powerful Rothschilds, whether on purpose or by happenstance, since the Rothschilds in any circumstance tend to exert massive authority wherever they go. So, it is the Rothschilds at the top of global economy through banks, and at the top of global politics through Masonry. It is for this reason that in countries dominated by global banking, people are particularly fond of conceiving racial ideas like “Semites” and “Aryans”.</p><p name="0997" id="0997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we have a situation wherein Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, writes in his Address to the Rothschilds that “anti-Semites will provide the requisite impetuous” for immigration to Israel, and that “Governments will, either voluntarily or under pressure from the anti-Semites, pay attention to this scheme.” We have the Rothschilds wining and dining with Herzl, clearly accepting his “scheme”. We have Jacob Rothschild reflecting on the earlier-mentioned Balfour Declaration as “so unlikely”, saying it happened only because an “impoverished scientist, Chaim Weizmann,” managed to “somehow” arrange a meeting with the Rothschilds, and then proceeded to “unbelievably (indeed, unbelievably!) persuade Balfour” and “most Ministers” into supporting the creation of Israel. We have the Nazis, Fascists, the British and Americans, the Israelis, and the Rothschilds themselves, all being extensively tied to Masonry and Masonic racialism, which calls for the superiority of the “Anglo-Nordic race” and the return of the “Israelites”, the “Semites”, to the “Promised Land”. We have the Rothschilds evidently asserting a considerable amount of control over Masonry, having even built multiple lodges, thus having the means to propagate this “scheme” Herzl described to them. We have the majority of Jews in Germany collaborating alongside, rather than being persecuted by, the Nazis; we have around 60,000 of these departing to Palestine to help create Israel. We also have the Rothschilds going almost completely unharmed by the Nazis in the course of the Holocaust. Finally, we have the President of Israel and the Rothschilds themselves saying that without Edmond Rothschild, there would be no Israel as we know it.</p><p name="46ae" id="46ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, the American Jewish Committee still angrily writes:</p><blockquote name="b1d1" id="b1d1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The most malicious of conspiracies about the Rothschilds is that they orchestrated the Holocaust to gain sympathy for Jews in order to create the State of Israel (see Holocaust denial). (64)</blockquote><p name="bcea" id="bcea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">One would think saying “The Rothschilds orchestrated the Holocaust” is decidedly not denying the Holocaust. In fact, the AJC’s page on “Holocaust Denial” doesn’t actually mention the Rothschilds at all, meaning the theory is not addressed in any way, shape, or form.</p><p name="9fe3" id="9fe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would seem that “the most malicious of conspiracies” was apparently not worth debunking. The reader may think of that all as they wish.</p><p name="fad4" id="fad4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We must also note the 1934 founding of the Israel General Bank, of which Edmond Adolphe was President, and the Israel Corporation Investment, into which he sank almost $1 million during the aftermath of the Six-Day War between the Jewish settlers and native Arabs. He, along with David Rockefeller, also would help carry out the creation of a trans-Israeli oil pipeline to siphon oil from the conquered Arab provinces through the company Permindex, a Swiss-based investment firm which contained as its board members Ferenc Nagy, the deposed Prime Minister of Hungary; George Mantello, a Jewish-Hungarian banker who Bloomfield calls the “genius” of Permindex and a “33rd degree Freemason” with “personal connections to the highest aristocratic circles” (66); Clay Shaw, a man who was later arrested on suspicion of having participated in the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Louis Bloomfield, a CIA agent (67). One almost feels crazy writing these things, but they are all unobjectionable facts: I did not mention any of the conspiracy theories about them (and there are plenty). The reader may look further if they do not believe me.</p><p name="c1a1" id="c1a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We should take a look at that other Permindex board member, Bloomfield. He was a Zionist, and wrote quite frankly in his personal letters which he donated to the National Library and Archives of Canada (ii): he documents David Rockefeller’s meeting with Pemindex’s Ferenc Nagy, which Bloomfield calls a “great success”, and in the same document he attaches what he calls an “official endorsement of the US Government”, saying “the US Department of Commerce itself will act as distributing center on our literature and as a source of information on our enterprise.”</p><p name="60f7" id="60f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also written is the following:</p><blockquote name="3daa" id="3daa" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If we sit back and wait for the political situation to clear up, we will no longer have the inside track with the Israeli government. The pipeline will be built and it is important that American interests should control it. I am sure that the US State Department will understand. Rarely does such a great historical opportunity present itself — to say nothing of a great financial coup. (68)</blockquote><p name="9eca" id="9eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The letter is signed: “Please let me know after you have spoken with Mr. Dulles. With best wishes, I remain, sincerely, LMB.”</p><p name="5245" id="5245" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s no mystery, really: Rockefeller was a long-time personal friend of Allen Dulles, the first Director of the CIA. Dulles ran the country’s first CIA offices from the Rockefeller Center, and Bloomfield himself was a CIA contact. Also written in Bloomfield’s letters are some shareholders of the Trans-Israeli Pipeline, the first two names being the obvious “Edmond de Rothschild” and “Louis Bloomfield” (69).</p><p name="63cd" id="63cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Trans-Israeli Pipeline still exists today, spanning 157 miles of occupied Arab territory. It produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day, and is owned by the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company, which itself is possessed entirely by the State of Israel. Who owns the State of Israel? We may trust the reader to figure that out.</p><p name="7b3e" id="7b3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Edmond Adolphe Rothschild (the grandson of Edmond James), who died just a couple decades ago in 1997, would carry on the Rothschild project of Israel with as much vigor as those before him. He donated all of his grandfather’s Palestine Jewish Colonization Association property to the newborn Israeli State in 1950, and further purchased 7,500 acres in 1953 to found the Caesarea Rothschild Foundation, co-owning it with the Israeli State directly. The owner of the Caesarea Foundation today, Ariane de Rothschild, fittingly said in 2015: “If there is a family that does not have to prove its commitment to Israel, it’s ours.” (65)</p><p name="49fe" id="49fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We should also acknowledge that Daniel Rothschild was a Major General in the Israeli Defense Forces until 1995, and is still the Chairman of the Herzliya Conference, a forum hosting the Israeli Prime Minister and other major state officials to discuss national policy. We have mentioned already that Jacob Rothschild currently sits on the Directory board of the Genie Energy company with such men as Dick Cheney and News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch; also on this board are the former CIA Director and Freemason (70) James Woolsey, former head of the US Treasury Larry Summers, owner of Fox Corp Rupert Murdoch, and ex-UN ambassador Bill Richardson.

(72) Meanwhile, the World Jewish Organization is led by David Rothschild, who hosted the Theodor Herzl Dinner attended by his brother, Jacob Rothschild (73).</p><p name="b7b8" id="b7b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The question, reader, is this: what are we to think will happen in the Middle East when the 400+ million Arabs bring fate upon the 9 million Israelis? They will learn how much a Rothschild really cares for his cousins — that once he can no longer defile them in unspeakable ways, he will abandon them for a younger, prettier “actress” instead.</p><h4 name="b534" id="b534" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">BRITANNICA DEMOLISHES THE ANTI-SEMITES</h4><p name="f484" id="f484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It should be easy to foresee certain criticisms in response to this writing, and so we will go ahead and address them here. We will confine ourselves to just a couple articles. These will come from sources which can by no means be called “fringe” sources — they are as mainstream as it gets, and we will see here how even the massive, world-known informational outlets take a shamelessly dishonest stance in defense of the Rothschilds, oftentimes extending into outright lying.</p><p name="afd5" id="afd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us begin with Encyclopedia Britannica, one of the most “objective” and reputable encyclopedias in the English speaking world. Whereas earlier, they were telling us that the “head of the English Rothschilds was the head of the English Jewry”, they now ask us with confusion: “Where do the Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories About the Rothschilds Come From?” (74).</p><p name="afe2" id="afe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us see how they answer this puzzling question. The article begins:</p><blockquote name="88f6" id="88f6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Rothschild family is arguably the most famous European banking dynasty in modern history. In the late 18th century, they expanded their bank into a multinational enterprise, and, with their newfound wealth, the Rothschilds were able to influence their local economies.</blockquote><p name="7ebe" id="7ebe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Britannica first tells us of the deeds of the Rothschilds in banking, deeds which bear little to no relation to their Judaism, much less their Zionism. Indeed, they practically say the Rothschilds owned Europe. Yet somehow, Britannica makes the following connection:</p><blockquote name="1cfc" id="1cfc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Rothschild family’s rapid accumulation of wealth and power was met with one odious reaction: rampant anti-Semitism.</blockquote><p name="c88c" id="c88c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let it be known reader — Britannica believes that wealth and power is why people associate the Rothschilds with Judaism, and not because they are “the head of the English Jewry” and the founders of Israel.</p><p name="b623" id="b623" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reader perhaps sees what I mean: it took only two sentences for the world-renown Britannica to prove just how “objective” they are. Yet, Britannica now flips things again. First, they said the Rothschilds are attacked for their Judaism because they are bankers; now, they say the Rothschilds are attacked for their banking because they are Jews:</p><blockquote name="b910" id="b910" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">As a Jewish family, the Rothschilds have been targeted by conspiracy theorists as a prime example of Jews allegedly using their money to control global financial institutions. These claims have been roundly condemned and proven false, but they continue to persist.</blockquote><p name="f321" id="f321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">According to Britannica, the devoutly Jewish and ardently Zionistic Rothschild family is “the most famous European banking dynasty in modern history”, “able to influence their local economies”, who “for some 200 years exerted great influence on the economic and political history of Europe.”</p><p name="af3d" id="af3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also according to Britannica, the Rothschilds are “targeted by conspiracy theorists” as an “example of Jews using money to control global institutions”, an idea which was “proven false” yet “continues to persist”.</p><p name="5f26" id="5f26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Britannica, like a child who is lying, cannot remember the details to their own story. We must recall the question posed in the title — Where do the Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories About the Rothschilds Come From? (74)</p><p name="b573" id="b573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apparently, from Britannica themselves! But let us see Britannica’s own answer:</p><blockquote name="43b5" id="43b5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Although anti-Semitic attacks on the Rothschild family have been thoroughly disproved, they have revealed themselves to be embedded in the Western cultural subconscious. Those who contribute to this form of anti-Semitism must make a sustained effort to root it out.</blockquote><p name="c233" id="c233" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In the end, we are given only a one sentence answer to the question: the claims about the Rothschilds “have revealed themselves to be embedded in the Western cultural subconscious.” That is where they come from. And how do we fix this apparent problem? “Those who contribute to it must root it out.”</p><p name="542a" id="542a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is a “cultural subconscious”? How did the ideas about the Rothschilds get into peoples’ “cultural subconscious” in the first place? How does one “root it out”? One raises these frankly obvious questions, but Britannica simply ends the article there, so we must move on.</p><p name="9056" id="9056" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us touch upon some other articles and see if they handle the subject more honestly. We quoted the American Jewish Committee earlier. They have their own page on the Rothschilds called Translate Hate: Rothschild. Let us see what they have to say.</p><blockquote name="81fc" id="81fc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Rothschilds are a Jewish banking family who have been accused of secretly controlling the economy, manipulating the weather, and profiting from wars.</blockquote><p name="a602" id="a602" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Secretly controlling the economy? They make no secret of it. Manipulating the weather? This is a disingenuous way of saying “facilitate climate change by funding oil companies, and also own the Weather Channel.” And “profiting from wars”? The Jewish Encyclopedia earlier said that “the [Napoleonic] Wars were the beginning of the great fortunes of the house.”</p><p name="dbd9" id="dbd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps they were just going for a “sensationalist” tone and overdid it. Let us move on to why the AJC thinks people accuse the Rothschilds of such things:</p><blockquote name="af52" id="af52" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In the mid-19th century, French antisemite Georges Dairnvaell published a pamphlet alleging Nathan Rothschild witnessed France’s defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and returned to London before the news broke to make 20 million francs on the stock exchange. All of this was false. Despite being provably false, the Dairnvaell pamphlet was reprinted and translated into many languages. The Rothschild family (and by extension Jews) were blamed for economic crises and wars for the next 200 years.</blockquote><p name="d2ee" id="d2ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Hear, hear! Not only does all hatred for the Rothschilds apparently come from a single pamphlet (which is actually so irrelevant, we have not even had to refer to it once throughout the entirety of this work) — no, this pamphlet is where all theories about Jews in general come from!</p><p name="4b90" id="4b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is an amazing revelation from the same people who earlier told us the theories about Jews came from “money-lending, trade, and commerce, the few professions Jews were allowed to have”, which “led to stereotypes about Jewish greed and wealth.” (4) No, now the Jews are an “extension” of the Rothschilds, and the Rothschilds are a completely innocent family of really harmless bankers that was merely implicated by a malicious 19th century pamphlet that most “conspiracy theorists” have never even heard of — that is the gist of the AJC’s position.</p><p name="916c" id="916c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us pass on to Paul Salmon Associates and their article Debunking the Rothschild Conspiracy (75), written by their owner Paul Salmons, an educator in Jewish and Holocaust history at University College London. They tell us:</p><blockquote name="ed5c" id="ed5c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The Rothschild conspiracy theory is an age-old myth that a single European Jewish banking family has the power to control world events. It has deep antisemitic roots, and over time has been used as a vehicle to promote different forms of hate. It continues to be cited today despite having no basis in reality. Using deep-seated pejorative and hateful stereotypes about Jews, it spreads lies about the prominent Rothschild family as symbols of a mythical ‘Jewish power’, said to be malevolently orchestrating world events and catastrophes.</blockquote><p name="3c51" id="3c51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Rothschild conspiracy theory forms a central strand of a wider delusion that the world and all its most pivotal events are controlled by a small, elite, powerful and secretive group. Even when that secretive group is ‘unmasked’ as a non-Jewish organization, for example the Freemasons or the Illuminati, still it is often claimed that behind them is a ‘Jewish cabal’ and — pulling the strings of them all — the Rothschilds.</p><p name="fa3b" id="fa3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evidently, Salmons has trouble even laying out the claim without layering it twice-over with his own arguments. Still, we are interested in how Paul Salmons “debunks” this horribly garbled form of our argument. He undertakes this task by attacking the concept of “conspiracy theories” altogether:</p><blockquote name="ecc4" id="ecc4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Conspiracy theories are false narratives that simplify highly complex events and processes by reducing them to ‘plots’ carried out by powerful people. Conspiracy theories are attractive because they appear to make sense of a confusing world. They often thrive in times of uncertainty, when events over which we have little say or understanding impact our lives. These could be economic crashes, rapid social change, wars, revolutions and political upheavals, or even pandemics. They appeal to a psychological need for security and stability because their simplistic explanations appear to put human beings squarely in control of events: a comforting notion in a frightening world.</blockquote><p name="d28a" id="d28a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Salmons’ point boils down to the following: people believe in theories about the Rothschilds because they are mentally insecure (unlike him). But what he actually describes is this: when the “certainty” of a people is undermined by faltering economic and political systems, it drives them to sincerely reevaluate the system in question. In doing so, many of them are bound to “pierce the mist” and find the source of the problem. But to Salmons, those people are not actually being driven to their senses by sudden shock — no, they are actually being traumatized and looking for comfort, and somehow, the idea that a clique of bankers runs the world is reassuring to them and not tremendously worrisome. The ultimate consequence, poor Salmons cries, is the “eroding of faith in institutions of knowledge and authoritative sources of information”, i.e. the institutions he runs and works for.</p><p name="1422" id="1422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having now “debunked” all conspiracy theories in general, Salmons feels it is safe to try at the Rothschilds alone. He says:</p><p name="e08b" id="e08b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Rothschilds are indeed a very wealthy family, but by no means the richest in the world or even close to it. Although in 2015 the Rothschild Group had an annual revenue of $500 million, that figure was dwarfed by the $500 billion revenue of the supermarket chain Wal-Mart, which is owned by a Christian family.</p><p name="c5a5" id="c5a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What he does not mention is that Wal-Mart is not a bank, but a department store owned by banks. Any money employed by Wal-Mart is money tied to, and controlled by, the major financial institutions, which themselves are tied to the Rothschilds, as we have already seen. Salmons hoped the reader would not know anything about finance banking, and would take his word for it. This of course makes him look quite suspicious when he — a financial expert — for some reason tells us:</p><p name="ca30" id="ca30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is ludicrous to suggest that a single family has the power to control the world’s banking institutions. But the facts do not matter to conspiracy theorists. Regardless of their actual material wealth or power, the Rothschilds are presented as leaders of a ‘global cabal’ because they are Jewish.</p><p name="79fa" id="79fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surely he knows how monopolisation and the influence of banks works?</p><p name="17a6" id="17a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us pass on to the last article — How the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds began (76), from RetroPod, a podcast hosted by The Washington Post. With scary music playing in the background, a man with a slight lisp angrily tells us:</p><blockquote name="4610" id="4610" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In so many conspiracy theories, there is some evil unknown force messing with reality. With some of these theories, at their very core is hatred. For instance, the weather, and how it not controlled by atmospheric conditions, but by Jews. And not just any Jews, but the Rothschild family.</blockquote><p name="2d6a" id="2d6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This was the logical conclusion for conspiracy theorists because they have been trying to pin world control on the family for centuries, with dozens, perhaps hundreds of unproved, bizarre, and anti-Semitic allegations. For example: they control the world economy; they plotted to kill John F. Kennedy; they founded Israel.</p><p name="9655" id="9655" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They founded Israel.” That is an “unproved, bizarre, anti-Semitic allegation,” according to The Washington Post. Meanwhile, the Rothschild Archive, run by the Rothschilds themselves, says:</p><blockquote name="603e" id="603e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Israel owes many of its early economic successes to the work of Edmond de Rothschild, who founded numerous colonies for Jewish settlers and enabled the settlers to establish their economic independence.</blockquote><p name="fbe4" id="fbe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Thus, according to The Washington Post, the Rothschilds are subscribing to “unproven, bizarre, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories” about themselves.</p><p name="55f2" id="55f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The question remains to be asked: why are these subjects always handled so dishonestly by the “reputable” media? As Theodor Herzl said in The Jewish State:</p><blockquote name="4f13" id="4f13" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">We are what the Ghetto made us. We have attained pre-eminence in finance. It is well known that the great majority of Jewish business men give their sons a superior education. Hence, the so-called “Judaizing” of all intellectual professions.</blockquote><p name="6c97" id="6c97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Encyclopedia Britannica — this is owned by Jacqui Safra.</p><p name="dfa1" id="dfa1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The American Jewish Committee — well, this should go without saying. This is run by Harriet Schleifer.</p><p name="71ca" id="71ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Washington Post, as the reader maybe already knows, is owned by Jeff Bezos.</p><p name="d6f4" id="d6f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for Paul Salmon Associates, this is of course led by Paul Salmon.</p><p name="4ec1" id="4ec1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are the fellows decrying the “anti-Semitism” of any who criticize the Rothschilds. The reader may look into each of these men on their own, and it should make sense enough.</p><h4 name="01ef" id="01ef" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">CONCLUSION</h4><p name="23bb" id="23bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">That is the family of the five arrows, the Rothschild family. “Do not bite the hand that feeds you!” — that is the motto of our critics.</p><p name="2881" id="2881" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the Rothschilds, and bankers in general, cannot let people have their peace. That is the basic truth. They must penetrate the living soul of every nation, disrupt it in a thousand ways, instill within it shame instead of pride, nihilism instead of vigor, decay instead of growth, despair instead of hope, eroticism instead of love, neediness instead of selflessness; this is the necessary psychology required for one to live in such a parasitic fashion and not persistently question it. This is what they do to all nations, what they have done to all nations, and what they will do to all nations, from their gilded palaces where shame knows no bounds.</p><p name="ea72" id="ea72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Inbreeding, palace-dwelling, money-lending, nation-killing, state-building — these are the “morals” of the Rothschilds, God’s chosen bankers.</p><p name="71fa" id="71fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">J.
