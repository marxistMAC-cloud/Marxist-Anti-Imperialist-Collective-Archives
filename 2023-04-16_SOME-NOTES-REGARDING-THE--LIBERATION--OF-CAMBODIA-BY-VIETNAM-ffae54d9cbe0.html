When the debate was made again regarding the wars in Indochina as related to the national question, I decided to not publish this as a separate article, but include it in my larger (unpublished) work on nationalism. What prompted me to publish this as a stand alone was a discussion I had with Markovic on the Khmer Rouge, and a general consensus within MAC that we need to speak more on the issue.</p><p name="d8de" id="d8de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When speaking of the Khmer Rouge, there are two kinds of Communists: first, the ones who completely, or almost completely ignore it or dismiss it, which themselves are divided into different groups with the common ground being that of their disdain or dismissal of this period and place in history. This kind forms the majority of Communists in the world today.</p><p name="fba7" id="fba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second kind consists of the few which in fact, try to look into the Khmer Rouge more closely, to draw conclusions and lessons from them, and who come to view the Khmer Rouge as part of the “open secret” of the world Communist movement, and this is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relation of Communism with nationalism.</em> The Marxist Anti-Imperialist collective in our writings always try to shed light to this “open secret”, and we are accused by many as “red fascists” due to us instead of just looking and describing history they way it suits our narrative, us taking in fact, lessons from it, and also trying to advance the theory of Marxism instead of getting stuck in the past. As dialectics teaches us, everything changes and moves, and the political lines drawn from Marxism are not an exception. We saw what happened when the Knights of the First International refused to advance from the old theory and lines, and we saw what happened to the ones who did not refuse to advance these. The first sided with the imperialists and became irrelevant to revolutionaries, the second were thrusted by the proletariat to power and are still studied vigorously by the revolutionaries of the world.</p><p name="5f1d" id="5f1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, we will speak about these two kinds of people and the implication of their thoughts.</p><p name="76b6" id="76b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not a crime to be wrong. If this was a crime, everyone would be a criminal. What is crime, is to be so strongly opinionated about a matter when you know nothing about it. What is an even worse crime is to have someone show you the data you don’t know (or you knew them beforehand), and keep insisting on your incoherent position. From the point of marxism and its scientific methodology, this is the highest of crimes.</p><p name="7417" id="7417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why do we say this? Just like communists do regarding the Taliban (i.e, lie without an inch of shame about their supposed CIA origins), they do the same thing about the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot. It is true that at some point, the Khmer Rouge did ally themselves with the US, and we will discuss this later. But besides of this, there is also the idea that the Khmer Rouge weren’t communists from the beginning, that they were a bunch of petty-bourgeois radical students, or even worse, that they were on the payroll of Americans from the beginning! Such lies are so ridiculous, that for one to believe them, one needs to delete all prior history prior to 1980.</p><p name="059e" id="059e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, we need to speak about the origins of Khmer Communism, and then touch a little on Pot. The origins of Khmer Communism, like all places in the world that communism was an actual mass movement, lie in nationalism. In 1930, there was no Cambodian state, nor Laotian state, nor Vietnamese state. What there was, was the colony of France, Indochina, which included all nations that resided there within it. The most advanced economically was the Vietnamese nation, where the French built heavy infrastructure to exploit the colony. The rest relied heavenly still on agrarian economy. Thus, we already have a big nation, which also has the potential to be the biggest economy in the area, the Vietnamese. We have vietnamese nationalism naturally rising, and with it, Vietnamese communism and radicalism. In 1930, the Vietnamese Communist Party, which included Khmers and Laotians in its ranks, changed its name into the Indochinese Communist Party. The explanation for the change of the name was the following:</p><blockquote name="fd07" id="fd07" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Previously, the parts in the country were unified into one party, named Vietnam Communist Party, from now on, it’s changed to Indochina Communist Party. Why? The three countries, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, although often called three countries, actually became only one country. Economically, there is still a close relationship with each other; Politically, they were all dominated and oppressed by the French Empire. The class of proletariat and all the toiling and oppressed masses in those three countries want to overthrow imperialism and regain independence and overthrow the kings and mandarins to liberate themselves, and they cannot fight alone. Okay. Therefore, the Communist Party, which is the vanguard of the class proletariat and the guide for all revolutionary people, cannot be confined to one country alone, Vietnam, or Cambodia, or Laos. To oppose a unified centralized force is to be the enemy of the revolution, there must be a Communist Party that concentrates the class of the proletariat forces in the whole of Indochina. For that reason, from now on, the Communist Party of Vietnam will be called the Communist Party of Indochina.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="6838" id="6838" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110929021149/http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=30063&amp;cn_id=159718" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110929021149/http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=30063&amp;cn_id=159718" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">https://web.archive.org/web/20110929021149/http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=30063&amp;cn_id=159718</em></a></blockquote><p name="25fe" id="25fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We see therefore, that this was a development spearheaded by the Vietnamese communists, who wished to make a single country out of the three. The rationale for the Laotians and the Khmers who were members of the new party made sense at the time, since the main enemy were the imperialists, so to combat them more effectively, their efforts needed to be unified. Nonetheless, we can see some Vietnamese Chauvinism here, from the speech of Ho Chi Min regarding the funding of the party:</p><blockquote name="1c96" id="1c96" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">World War Two will break out. When it does the French imperialists will certainly drive our people to an even more horrible slaughter. If we let them prepare for this war, oppose the Chinese revolution and attack the Soviet Union, if we allow them to stifle the Vietnamese revolution. This is tantamount to letting them wipe our race off the surface of the earth and drown our nation in the Pacific.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="6c03" id="6c03" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">However, the French imperialists’ barbarous oppression and ruthless exploitation have awakened our compatriots, who have all realized that revolution is the only road to survival and that without it they will die a slow death. This is why the revolutionary movement has grown stronger with each passing day: the workers refuse to work, the peasants demand land, the students go on strike, the traders stop doing business. Everywhere the masses have risen to oppose the French imperialists.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="c637" id="c637" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The revolution has made the French imperialists tremble with fear. On the one hand, they use the feudalists and comprador bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit our people. On the other, they terrorize, arrest, jail, deport and kill a great number of Vietnamese revolutionaries. If the French imperialists think that they can suppress the Vietnamese revolution by means of terror, they are grossly mistaken. For one thing, the Vietnamese revolution is not isolated but enjoys the assistance of the world proletariat in general and that of the French working class in particular. Secondly, it is precisely at the very time when the French imperialists are frenziedly carrying out terrorist acts that the Vietnamese Communists, formerly working separately, have united into a single party, the Indochinese Communist Party, to lead the revolutionary struggle of our entire people.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="f1f3" id="f1f3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1930/02/18.htm" data-href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1930/02/18.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1930/02/18.htm</em></a></blockquote><p name="46e1" id="46e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What we see here, is that there is no mention of Khmer or Laotian revolutionaries, just of the Vietnamese ones, of the Vietnamese nation, and of the Vietnamese revolution. There is also explicitly said that the “Vietnamese communists” (implying perhaps the Khmers and Laotians?) have united into a single, “Indochinese” party (nothing more than the name of a geographical destination) to wage a revolutionary struggle for ‘our entire people’. In my opinion, it is clear what Ho had in his mind.</p><p name="b106" id="b106" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nonetheless, some decades later, and in 1951, the party split into its actual parts, the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian parties. From then on, we can clearly see that the nationalists of the other big nations would never accept a common multinational state which would obviously be dominated, both regarding the number of population, and of economy and politics, by the Vietnamese nation.</p><p name="abd6" id="abd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Khmers established their own party, the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party, which in turn established a subsidiary party named Prachachon in order to run in the national election that year. The name of the party was changed to the Workers’ Party of Kampuchea on 28 September 1960 and then to the Communist Party of Kampuchea in 1966, which is what came to be known as the “Khmer Rouge”.</p><p name="4455" id="4455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, we know that: a) the idea of a single Indochina state emerged from Vietnamese communists b) once communists from the other nations of indochina started to mature, they eventually cut this idea short by making their own parties.</p><p name="12ae" id="12ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What we need to discuss now is Pot. We won’t do a biography, just mention that Pot was a child by the time the ICP was created in 1930, and by the time it was dissolved in 1945, he was a 20 years old student in Cambodia. Many leaders of his government were friends of his from this time period, telling us that the young group of friends had plans for Cambodia and weren’t just friends playing around. According to rumors, at the time, he worked for the anti-imperialist Khmer socialist and nationalist party Democratic Party. Later on, he went to France, where he got himself affiliated with a lot of communists, French and not-French. It is clear, that by now, he was a Communist, or at least had communist leanings, since in 1950, he went to work in Yugoslavia in voluntary labor unit, and had joined the Communist Party of France, and helped form a lot of Marxist reading clubs (for those who claim that he knew nothing of marxism, it is obvious he knew a lot). In this period he read a lot of Marx, Mao, and Stalin. Later, he went back to Cambodia, and entered some Vietnamese and Khmer insurgent organizations.</p><p name="7411" id="7411" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later on, Pot and his comrades drafted a new program for their communist party, where it was specified that they would be allied (but not under the rule) with the Vietnamese. He ended up climbing up, and becoming one of the leaders of the Cambodian communist movement.</p><p name="a164" id="a164" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only this, but his party participated in the armed struggle against the imperialists both for his own country, and in helping his Vietnamese comrades. Later on, he leaded the war against the Khmer Compradors in the Cambodian civil war, where the US killed up to 200,000 Khmers in one of the biggest bombardment operations ever (this bombardment forms the basis of the myth of the ‘Cambodian genocide’, that the Vietnamese communist party so shamelessly spreaded left and right).</p><p name="01b1" id="01b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can see therefore, that to claim that Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge were ‘fake’, or ‘agents’, is to completely ignore history, to completely ignore the marxist method, and to be in line completely with liberal thinking of the world and history.</p><p name="e773" id="e773" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not our goal here to explain the national question, or to advance the theory from where the bolsheviks had let it. We can not do this in this article, since it is neither its purpose, nor it is allowed from our part to do this in this frame. What is obvious is that “Indochina” was not a nation, just a territory, including many nations (and many proto-nations, i.e tribes with a different language than the rest, but not big enough to be nations). Because it is not the scope of this article, we just need to mention that the three biggest nations in indochina were the Vietnamese (today it has 76 million people), the Khmers (16 million) and the Laotian (30 million). In south Vietnam, there was Cochinchina, a former Khmer territory captured by Vietnam during feudal wars. At the moment of the liberation of indochina, Cochinchina had majority Khmers in the north and south of it, and Majority Vietnamese at the center of it. Naturally, the wish of the Khmers was to incorporate their areas back to Cambodia, but since the national question was never solved in Indochina, there were a series of wars that kept going well after the cold war between the stateless nations in it, or between the nations that had a state but wished to unify their territories.</p><p name="90de" id="90de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The right thing to do, to secure the alliance of the Vietnamese and Khmers, would be to divide Cochinchina between the two states. Of course, this never happened, and not only this, but Vietnam even invaded Cambodia and occupied it for multiple years, putting the monarchy back in power, and demolishing communism in Cambodia.</p><p name="382d" id="382d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does this tell us? It tells us that the Vietnamese Communist Party did not respect internationalism. They were nationalists for their own (which is good), but their nationalism developed to chauvinism, against the Khmers and against the other nations of the state of Vietnam.</p><p name="9362" id="9362" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Were the Khmer Rouge saints? We don’t think so. They also were probably, to some degree or another, chauvinists against other nations. The information about this are just the usual liberal propaganda (also fostered by Vietnam) about the ‘genocide’ e.t.c, therefore, this figure also includes non-khmers who were persecuted systematically. More information is needed on this before we can say with certainty, but what we need to remember first and foremost, that any Khmer chauvinism does not justify Vietnamese chauvinism at all. The Vietnamese cannot play the policeman of Indochina, when they themselves have 20% of their state’s population being non-vietnamese, including the Khmers in Cochinchina.</p><p name="30c6" id="30c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We do not wish to downplay Vietnam’s heroic struggle, neither try to ‘diminish’ Ho Chi Min from the status of the Great revolutionary that he was. But we also need to be blunt in our scientific work, that X is X and Y is Y. We aren’t here following a religion, but for the truth, so we are able to draw ultimate conclusions for our own future.</p><p name="b552" id="b552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, why do the communists wish to hide history? For the same reason the fall of Yugoslavia was just “US’s fault” or something, i.e they wish to avoid the honest truth, that if communism failed in a X area, it means it had itself some elements that formed the negation of the negation, i.e that the Americans used already existing contradictions. It is the same as in religion, where there can be no ‘wrong’, or mistake in the machine. What are these elements? In our opinion, a big one is the national question. It is the national question most communists who speak of the Khmer Rouge wish to avoid, because they themselves are chauvinists, either conscious or unconscious. To be able to speak about the Cambodian war on these terms, is to see how big of an utopia the idea of a multinational formation even is. Is to see, that the proletariat does in fact care about its nation, and it will fight for it, even abandoning communism if its enemy are other communists (for example Pol Pot died being politically a pro-westerner, having been dissatisfied about how world communists treated his movement). Not only the idea of multinational formations (always based on assimilationist chauvinism) is an utopia, but in its root, is quite reactionary. It pushes nations to fight one another, and it also pushes nations to abandon communism, it makes the proletarian vulnerable to the leadership of the foreign and local bourgeoisie. “Look, the proletariat of the enemy nation is the one who wants to disappear you!”. It is the biggest internal enemy of communism and of the proletariat movement, and to turn a blind eye to this reality for the sake of petty politics, it is truly the reactionary thing to do.</p><p name="d025" id="d025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To close, the war of Cambodia vs Vietnam not only should be dismissed as ‘vietnamese liberating poor cambodians from oppressive pol pot’, but it should be heavenly investigated by us. It is a treasure in a way for us to research, not only because of its lessons on nationalism and chauvinism, but also in the internal policies of the Khmer Rouge in its own right.</p><p name="3163" id="3163" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F.
