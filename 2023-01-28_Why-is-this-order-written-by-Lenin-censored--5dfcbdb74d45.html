Why is that work from our respected comrade<br>censored?</p><p name="4522" id="4522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it dares to speak about two fundamental questions<br>regarding (1) the National Question (particularly the Ukrainian<br>question) and (2) the Jewish Question.</p><p name="432f" id="432f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Jews will obviously cry at us about the speeches from<br>Lenin opposed to Anti-Semitism, or the Oblast, by not<br>understanding the Bolshevik strategy of assimilating the Jews<br>to Russiandom.</p><p name="b146" id="b146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here, we see an un-filter Lenin, a Lenin who doesn’t play<br>the politician, a Lenin who is ready to say openly the Soviet<br>policy regarding Jewry.</p><h3 name="19f6" id="19f6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Draft Theses of the Central Committee RKP(b) Concerning Policy in the Ukraine</h3><p name="fe4e" id="fe4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">[Prior to 21 November 1919]<br>Theses accepted (in principle, for editing)</p><p name="22ce" id="22ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Greatest caution regarding nationalist traditions, strictest observance of equality of the Ukrainian language and culture, all officials to be required to study the Ukrainian language, and so on and so forth. 7. <br>2. Temporary bloc with the Borotbists(1) to form a center(2) ( before the convocation of the Congress of Soviets, with the concurrent launching of a propaganda campaign for the complete merger [of the Ukraine] with the RSFSR.(3) For the time being, an independent Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in close federation with the RSFSR, on the basis of 1 June 1919.(4) <br>3. In connection with the advance of Red Army troops in to the Ukraine, intensified work on the [class] differentiation of the village; singling out three groups; recruiting poor peasants (+ middle peasants)(5) into the administration. Rendering the kulaks completely harmless. <br>4. Immediately and without fail admit to all revolutionary committees and local soviets no fewer than half of the local peasants, first from among the poorest(6) and second from the middle ones(7). The strictest requirement of accounting for the implementation of this demand by all non-local [party] workers, by all those sent from the center(8),” by all members of the intelligentsia, etc. Detailed working out of procedures for this accounting, and oversight of their actual implementation. <br>5. The countryside must be disarmed without fail and at all costs. <br>6. Food work in the Ukraine: first, give priority to feeding Kharkov and the Donetsk Basin; second, delay extraction of the surpluses from the Ukraine to Russia, stretching it out as much as possible (that is, getting by in Russia with our [own] surpluses); third, use any extraction of surpluses to feed the local poor peasants no matter what, giving them without fail a share [of what is] taken from the kulaks; fourth, in general, conduct the food policy more cautiously than in Russia, sparing the middle peasant more, taking fewer surpluses, etc.(9)</p><p name="faeb" id="faeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">8. [Place] the teachers’ union [spil’ka], the cooperatives, and other such petty bourgeois organizations in the Ukraine under special surveillance, with special measures for their disintegration, for the singling out of Communists, etc. <br>9. Initiate immediately especially energetic training of a special cadre of [party] workers for the Ukraine with specially reinforced surveillance and screening. Quickly carry out such preparations both through all the individual people’s commissariats and through the Orgburo. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Treat the Jews (10) and urban inhabitants in the</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ukraine with an iron rod, transferring them to the front,</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not letting them into government agencies (except in an</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">insigni</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">fi cant percentage, in particularly exceptional</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">circunstances, under class control (11) ).</strong></p><p name="e2ee" id="e2ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. In the margin “N.B.: include them in the Third International?” was crossed out by Lenin. 10. <br>2. The word was substituted for government by Lenin. The following line was crossed out by Lenin: “In a minority; one can also include other parties, [but] all in a minority.” <br>3. In the margin appears the phrase “in a veiled manner.” <br>4. This paragraph was struck out by Lenin. In the margin: “The Ukrainian workers and peasants will decide their own fate.” <br>5. Substituted by Lenin for “and only [the poor peasants].’ <br>6. Lenin added “in a majority.” <br>7. Lenin added “in a minority.” <br>8. Lenin struck out Russia. <br>9.

Lenin is declaring the reality of the situation that Marx and Engels also understood, that Jewry comes firstly from the money system and must be abolished with capitalism, and will loose all its force with Capitalism. And some so-called marxists are crying about Anti-Semitism.</p><p name="98e3" id="98e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, we will, like our mentor Lenin, fight the chauvinism and Slavish takes from our current “Marxists”.</p><figure name="f79c" id="f79c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*sF-BoGE13GFb_Tm-" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sF-BoGE13GFb_Tm-"></figure><p name="b3e4" id="b3e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="37fb" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f9e7" id="f9e7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/01/28/why-is-this-order-written-by-lenin-censored/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/01/28/why-is-this-order-written-by-lenin-censored/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on January 28, 2023.</em></p></div></div></section>
