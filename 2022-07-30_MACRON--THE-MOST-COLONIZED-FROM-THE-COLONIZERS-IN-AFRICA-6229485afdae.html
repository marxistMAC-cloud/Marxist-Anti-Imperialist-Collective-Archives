<section name="37e5" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3034" id="3034" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">MACRON: THE MOST COLONIZED FROM THE COLONIZERS IN AFRICA</h3><p name="3ede" id="3ede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For a certainty, Macron is the ultimate proof that bankers from the Rothschild group can’t lead countries in the name of the national interests, but in the names of the bankers, and their monstrous class, the bourgeoisie.</p><p name="30f6" id="30f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Macron proved to be the destructor of France as a sovereign Nation with his privatizations and dislocation of the French strategic assets and social system to fit with the Euro-Atlantic model promoted by the neo-liberal National Reform Programmes and Stability — Convergence Programmes, his obvious submission to Germany and EU through the Aix-La-Chapelle treaty which will officially give the future right of Germany to use French deterrent nuclear power and the French seat in the Security Council of UN for its own imperialist interests, and the obvious submission to NATO regarding Syria, Belarus, Afghanistan and against all French national interests but for only Washington’s ones.</p><p name="14df" id="14df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But we have seen that there is one field where France will always protect its national (and imperialist) interests : Africa. We have seen multiple times, monopolies in France exploiting the proletariat in Africa, like for example, the bourgeois, Vincent Bolloré, known with the name “Mister Africa” because the entirety of his companies are based in West Africa. He led many corrupted and powerful transports, infrastructures, ports, medias and telecommunications companies in these areas, leading an Empire capable of influencing presidents, with The Havas communication subsidiary which would have served the leaders of the Bolloré Empire to help African leaders gain power: Alpha Condé in Guinea and Faure Gnassingbé in Togo (Presidents with otherwise dubious elections and particularly contested anti-social policies) who helped the Bolloré Empire gaining ground by taking grounds from other imperialist monopolies to give them to Bolloré group. We can see the French major oil group Total, which exploited nothing less than a third of the oil resources of Libya after the imperialist intervention in this Nation according to the leaks of the emails of Hilary Clinton.</p><p name="57c2" id="57c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Obviously, all these imperialist interests are eased by the Franc CFA, a weapon of plunder and domination that forced the African neo-colonies and French monopolies to deposit in the Banque de France’s operating account 50% of their foreign exchange reserve.</p><p name="3e93" id="3e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Macron is known for his lack of respect for Presidents of these neo-colonies, like in 2017, when responding to a student asking him about electricity shortages in a press conference at university of Ouagadougou said :</p><blockquote name="5179" id="5179" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">You talk to me as if I were the president of Burkina! You talk to me as if I were still a colonial power! But I don’t want to deal with Burkina’s electricity!</em></blockquote><p name="e238" id="e238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And when Roch Kaboré, president of Burkina-Faso, left the room.</p><blockquote name="3dbf" id="3dbf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">He left to fix the air conditioning !</em></blockquote><p name="a288" id="a288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">From 25th of July 2022, Macron started a diplomatic visit in the neo-colonies to check up and, according to Ouest France :</p><blockquote name="4382" id="4382" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The Élysée first wants to highlight the Farm initiative. Launched at the end of March with the European Union, the G7 and the African Union, it aims to boost agricultural production in a global context of food insecurity and make Cameroon an example.”</em></blockquote><p name="671e" id="671e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In summary, France wants Cameroon to stop having trade with Russia to become completely dependent on the EU and France and make the colonization longer.</p><p name="9c3c" id="9c3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Benin, he made one of the most absurd declarations in his life (and this is the person who explained that bombing Syria is not declaring war to Assad, that unempoyed people just need to come across the street to find a job, that liberalism is a value from the left, and that Pétain was a great general):</p><blockquote name="f45a" id="f45a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“ Russia is one of the last imperial colonial power by invading a neighboring country to defend its interests…. I on a continent which suffered from colonial imperialism “</em></blockquote><p name="e3a4" id="e3a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We can remark three important things :</p><p name="f02b" id="f02b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Macron has obviously a liberal way of seeing imperialism, equating invading a country with colonialism…</p><p name="dedf" id="dedf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Macron thinks seriously that he is worthy to defend Africa against the imperialist Russia when he is himself the agent of French imperialism in Africa.</p><p name="96fe" id="96fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Macron, with this declaration, proves that he actually doesn’t care about the continent he steps foot in, by implying that colonial Imperialism isn’t still going on and is just a thing from the past.</p><p name="3865" id="3865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can thank Macron for one thing : he proved to us what is the kind of person who talks about Russian imperialism to any kind of Maoists.</p><p name="e5af" id="e5af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Cameroon. This was even more scandalous and atrocious, according to Le Média, one of the only honest media in France.</p><p name="f6d0" id="f6d0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Paid applause, businesses demolished to the chagrin of the local population… As Emmanuel Macron went to Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, the streets through which he had to pass were first cleaned of their buildings deemed too unsightly. “We should not offend the visual sensitivity of the first of the French”, notes our journalist Théophile Kouamouo. “Along the itinerary of the French president’s stay in Yaoundé, everything has been razed. […] A drinking establishment, counters, kiosks for shops whose death certificate bears a name: Emmanuel Macron”, relates the media Naja TV, which gives the floor to Ernest, one of the victims, who saw his shoe repair kiosk destroyed. “What’s the point of fighting poverty if you can make the poor disappear?” concludes Théophile Kouamouo.</p><p name="1fc7" id="1fc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Great God of Lighting, Justice and Equality, Emmanuel Macron, proved that he was nothing more than the King of these nations, an Emperor of the French Colonial Empire, while everyone knows that he is the buffoon of the Imperialist world, the clown of America.</p><p name="26e9" id="26e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s hope that the progressive forces, proletariat and bourgeois, manage to take out the French presence like these forces in Mali and Burkina-Faso managed to do.</p><p name="bdd1" id="bdd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And let’s hope that the President of this Euro-Atlantic province named France gets what he deserves by a new Revolution like the Frenchmen know how to do it, Even if, as a symbol, in the place of the tricolor flag, of the red flag… This will be the yellow vest.</p><p name="f677" id="f677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gracchus Jadid 30/7/2022</p><figure name="33a6" id="33a6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*gX6QgGBv2ZJ6HzS8" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gX6QgGBv2ZJ6HzS8"></figure></div></div></section><section name="7233" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4184" id="4184" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/07/30/macron-the-most-colonized-from-the-colonizers-in-africa/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/07/30/macron-the-most-colonized-from-the-colonizers-in-africa/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on July 30, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
