His words really tell us a lot: They tell us what they fear and what their aim is.</p><p name="7ee7" id="7ee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We can’t let that happen.</p><p name="f692" id="f692" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reality is that Biden is not afraid about Trump, he is afraid about his electoral basis. Is not the liberal from Queens who is being attacked, it is the loudest part o his electoral basis, the white nationalists, the only real insidethreat to the american government and the american imperialism. Their fear is separatism.</p><p name="4246" id="4246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this is not for us to speculate, Biden admits so himself.</p><p name="b339" id="b339" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No nation in the world can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. No one else can challenge us.</p><p name="da63" id="da63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aside from his fascistic-chauvinistic speech, Biden makes clear that one of the biggest threats in America right now, are the people who dont want to integrate themselves in the «American Nation». This goes for every separatist, white and black alike. But since the white nationalist are the bigger group, they are the real danger.</p><p name="a353" id="a353" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Separatism is the only thing right now that can tear america apart(America «itself»), and this is the fear Biden and the US cosmopolitan bourgeoisie have.</p><p name="9a3f" id="9a3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most blatant statement about this fear is this: And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of his campaign. Dividing America. Tearing us apart. Pitting Americans against one another based on our race, our gender, our ethnicity, our religion. That’s wrong.</p><p name="5d63" id="5d63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are.</p><p name="239b" id="239b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why the BLM and the other social fascist movements are hand in hand with the democrats. The reality is not progressivism or any other non sense, it is the aim to mitigate the contradictions in America by finishing the process of nationalization of America, of making the different nations one single nation, and all these in the basis of fascism-imperialism.</p><p name="a23a" id="a23a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Indeed, the four years of Trump could not mitigate the contradictions in US. Trump, an irrelevant politician who was staring at advertisements for NWA and some Pizzas perhaps even himself could not fathom that by making his person appear as the representative of the white nationalists just to become president and accumulate more money for himself, would unleash a beast that was hiding in America (that revealed itself some times, but not anything big enough as of now). The beast is what the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie in America use as one of the stronger weapons against their communist enemies; Separatism.</p><p name="a660" id="a660" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F.
