Wells was not only an author of fiction. This “bourgeois philistine” (as Lenin called him) also wrote The Open Conspiracy and The New World Order, political manifestos calling on global capitalists to create a single world government, religion, and language; he also called for the destruction of the working class, nations, and all “backwards” ideas which threaten bourgeois-globalist interests. Wells was a member of the<br>ultra-elite Pilgrims and Fabian Societies. His manifestoes were openly praised by Prime Ministers David Lloyd George and Harold Macmillan, by leading banker Lionel Rothschild, and by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, a leading mind behind the U.</p><blockquote name="0e58" id="0e58" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Open Conspiracy does not want to destroy existing controls, but to amalgamate them into a common world directorate…. The Open<br>Conspiracy is necessarily opposed to all national loyalties. Loyalty to the country passes into plain treason to mankind. The world commonwealth will need its own protection so long as there are people running about the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons, interfering with the free movement of commodities in the name of national sovereignty.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="b9a0" id="b9a0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">H.G. Wells, The Open Conspiracy.</em></blockquote><h4 name="683c" id="683c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">An Introduction to Conspiracy Theories, Featuring the UN</h4><p name="9b5f" id="9b5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Every conscious worker knows that the world is run by a cabal of blood-sucking parasites who care little for the general cause of mankind, the fate of nations, or the plight of industry. Their name: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">capitalists</em>. Their<br>conspiracy: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to amass capital</em>. It goes without saying that the conspiracy to amass capital naturally gives rise to hundreds of other, smaller conspiracies, ranging from the killing of individuals, the overthrow of states, the manipulation of economies, the manufacture of wars, and so on. The thinking worker has known these great “secrets” on an intuitive level since the dawn of his existence. In the mid-19th century, Marx provided the scientific foundations that would prove the foundation of all<br>bourgeois rule is nothing more than a conspiracy of economic parasitism. In the midst of the First World War, Lenin showed that it is not the capitalist’s moral failing, but the physical necessities which presuppose his very existence that drive him unfailingly to engage<br>in the most extreme abuses of humanity. This conspiracy against mankind is easily proven by simple economic theory. If one follows Lenin’s theories of monopolism and the clique-forming tendency of finance capital to their conclusion, they are naturally led to discover such organizations as Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, Chatham House, Brookings Institution, World Economic Forum, Business Roundtable, and so on, all the way down to the more abstract fraternities, like Freemasonry and B’nai B’rith. It becomes apparent that the world’s richest men, like Gates and Bezos, are nothing more than appendages of a far greater, far more vicious system of centuries-old international banking cartels.</p><p name="103e" id="103e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bourgeoisie, around 150 years late to the matter, are finally getting around to this accusation leveled upon them. The United Nations, the leading forum of global bourgeois rule, has just recently published what<br>is perhaps one of the most bizarre and ill-advised “public awareness” campaigns in the history of elite bourgeois politics. This was done through their public relations arm, UNESCO.</p><figure name="9989" id="9989" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*HSKaJox6_gn91lSw" data-width="375" data-height="225" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HSKaJox6_gn91lSw"></figure><blockquote name="4e41" id="4e41" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Think before sharing: stop the spread of conspiracy theories,” writes UNESCO. “Conspiracy theories cause real harm to people, to their health, and also to their physical safety. They amplify and legitimize misconceptions, and reinforce stereotypes which can fuel violence and violent extremist ideologies… A new campaign helps you learn how to identify, debunk, react to and report on conspiracy theories to prevent their spread. Check out the infographics and social media pack and help spread the word that facts matter and nobody is to blame. Thinking critically and being informed about conspiracy theories is key to challenging them. Conspiracy theories can be dangerous: they often target and discriminate against vulnerable groups, ignore scientific evidence and polarize society with serious consequences. This needs to stop.</em></blockquote><p name="df2d" id="df2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This UN campaign, titled “Think Before Sharing”, seeks to distribute 10 pre-made infographics devised and approved by elite capitalists in order to debunk (or “prebunk”) the notion that elite capitalists exploit the world economic and political order for their own benefit. The basic idea is that one can go to UNESCO’s website, download these infographics, and post them online — especially on social media — in response to anybody who spreads “conspiracy theories”, so as to “stop the spread” of these most dangerous ideas. If the reader looks up the phrase “think before you share,” they will find a slew of prominent government and academic websites using the exact phrase to spread the exact same message as the UN.</p><p name="bd71" id="bd71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not sure who the target demographic for this is, since I cannot imagine the type of person that would share them without being paid by the UN directly. Realistically, posting these infographics in an argument will probably just be met with a bunch memes calling the person who posted them a retard. Nonetheless, we should review this campaign in more detail for the sake of understanding the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">mindset </em>of the rootless cosmopolitans who drive the world-state. But before we undertake this effort, it is necessary that we understand <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">who exactly</em> stands behind this bold challenge to our common intellect.</p><h4 name="d86d" id="d86d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Who is Behind the Campaign?</h4><p name="0c3b" id="0c3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Who is behind the “Think Before Sharing” campaign? Who is responsible for its creation? Luckily, UNESCO does not hide the fact, and instead boasts of it at the very top of the campaign’s website.</p><blockquote name="612f" id="612f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">This UNESCO campaign is implemented jointly with the European Commission, Twitter, and the World Jewish Congress.</em></blockquote><p name="4780" id="4780" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The UN, as seen above, names three partners. These partners are seriously remarkable. For an attempt to dissuade the masses of an elite conspiracy, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the UN could not have picked three worse institutions.</em></p><p name="a176" id="a176" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us start with the European Commission (EC). There is a good chance that if the reader is not European (or even if they are), they have never heard of the EC, or at least have never researched it beyond its name. The EC sits behind the European Union, European Parliament, and a tangled network of European bureaucracy, drawing these elements together into one solid unit. The EC is the engine which, along with the less ‘official’ Pan-European Union, drives the whole project for European integrationism.</p><p name="1ab5" id="1ab5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Founded in the aftermath of WWII, the EC was largely the project of Frenchman Jean Monnet (pictured), an extremely wealthy cognac merchant who had an extensive affair with one of his married 21-year-old employees, the Italian Silvia Giannini, when he was 41 (Monnet eventually convinced Giannini to renounce her Italian citizenship and become a Soviet citizen entirely so that she could divorce her old husband under the Soviet laws and remarry to Monnet without delay). Like all wealthy perverts, Monnet was a powerful man: he was close to Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Arthur Balfour, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and plenty more; his sister was a Catholic activist who introduced him to Pope Paul VI. In 1950, five years after the end of WWII and eight years before the founding of the European Commission, Monnet began his long career in elite politics when he gathered several leading German politicians in his house: Robert Schuman, Walter Hallstein, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, René Pleven, and Helmut Schmidt.</p><figure name="09cd" id="09cd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*DzPQxG5-7PkxbhPP" data-width="103" data-height="151" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DzPQxG5-7PkxbhPP"></figure><p name="cf7a" id="cf7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Robert Schuman is considered the father of the European Union. Helmut Schmidt served in the Nazi Luftwaffe (Air Force). Walter Hallstein and was an Oberleutnant in the Nazi Wehrmacht, and helped carry out the extermination of foreign populations during WWII before co-founding the German branch of UNESCO. Adenauer was Mayor of Cologne for the entire Weimar Republic era: in this capacity, he declared that the NSDAP “should take a leading role in the German government” shortly before their rise to power, and for this was directly praised by Hitler. He also exchanged letters with President of the Reich Hermann Goring. Adenauer then became the first post-war Chancellor of Germany, and 68% of the officials in his cabinet were former NSDAP members: Adenauer’s government had more NSDAP members <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">than even Hitler’s government</em>, a fact recognized by mainstream academia.</p><p name="557c" id="557c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was these Fascist gentlemen who, with the distinguished pervert Monnet, devised the general economic program for the broad assimilation of all Europe, something the Nazis, particularly Hallstein (and 10 Anglo Fascists under Mosley), had in the past declared as their primary aim, calling this idea the “Europäische Neuordnung” (lit. “New European Order”). The European Commission, the spearhead of this revised, more liberal Europäische Neuordnung, was founded in 1958. Hallstein, having been a Wehrmacht Lieutenant just 13 years prior, became its first President. This is the history which the UN insists you should not be suspicious of.</p><figure name="d5b6" id="d5b6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*AicrVMdP_T75F5Wp" data-width="302" data-height="260" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AicrVMdP_T75F5Wp"></figure><p name="b519" id="b519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Widely recognized as the EC’s most influential President was Jacques Delors, who served from 1985 to 1995 after a stint as President of the European Parliament (1979–1981) and Minister of Finance for France (1981–1984). Delors came from a family of wealthy Parisian bankers, and from 1940 to 1960 worked extensively with the Banque 11 de France, an infamous financial institution much like the US Federal Reserve which has since its inception been dominated by the Rothschilds and other global banking dynasties (known in France as “the 200 families”). Delors is largely credited as the mastermind of the modern European economy: he devised the plan of a single European market with open borders, and it was under his direction that the EC created the Euro, a currency for all Europe, in 1992</p><figure name="62fc" id="62fc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*W14eIngbtnz_a0eE" data-width="103" data-height="143" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*W14eIngbtnz_a0eE"></figure><p name="f70a" id="f70a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Delors was also a member of the Club of Rome, an elite invitation-only think-tank for UN members and global capitalists. This Club speaks openly of their desire to sabotage the development of national industry and the growth of populations, doing so particularly in their notorious <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Limits of Growth </em>(1972). This Club was founded by the American capitalist David Rockefeller, of the Rockefeller oil dynasty. We should briefly divert from the subject of the European Commission to speak of the Rockefeller dynasty, and of the connections which they boast. This will allow us to see who stands behind the men who run Europe.</p><p name="c284" id="c284" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So much could be said of the Rockefellers: enough to write a book longer than the Bible. They have their hands in everything, and it is easy for the reader to find this on their own accord. But we will not say anything about the Rockefellers at all. Instead, we will let David Rockefeller explain his family in his own words. The following passage comes from page #405 of Rockefeller’s 2002 autobiography Memoirs, and the reader is seriously urged to look it up if they do not believe it is real.</p><blockquote name="4a8a" id="4a8a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">For more than a century,” writes Rockefeller, “Extremists at either end of the political spectrum attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the country, accusing my family and myself of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it!</em></blockquote><p name="ebf5" id="ebf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">David Rockefeller is but one of many Rockefellers. This single Rockefeller is by himself responsible for so many deeds. Here is an example: he is the man responsible for the sudden elite status of international child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who inexplicably went from being an irrelevant schoolteacher to a trustee at Rockefeller University, a member of Rockefeller’s Trilateral Commission, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (with the Rockefellers and Rothschilds), and so on. Indeed, David Rockefeller was personally on Epstein’s flight logs. All of this is public record.</p><p name="fa91" id="fa91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2018, David Rockefeller sat in his mansion, which is filled with paintings of naked children and Turkish sex-slaves. Beside him sat an English Jew named Jacob Rothschild (pictured). Rothschild’s son, Nathan, was good friends with Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Jacob’s cousin, Evelyn, met Lynn (now Evelyn’s wife) after being introduced to her by Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, at a Bilderberg Meeting. In total, eight members from Rothschild’s 13 family were on Epstein’s flight logs. This clique is also very close with the Clinton and McCain families. As the Rockefellers are the most powerful industrial dynasty in the world, so the Rothschilds are the most powerful banking dynasty in the world. It is not even a contest. The Rothschilds <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">invented </em>global banking. They stand behind every royal family, every media tycoon, every elite politician, every monopolist businessman. This is attested to in Niall Furgeson’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">House of Rothschild: the World’s Banker,</em> which was praised by the Rothschild family directly.</p><figure name="b19e" id="b19e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*vch-wuAxkAdOsVq5" data-width="113" data-height="174" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vch-wuAxkAdOsVq5"></figure><p name="1b98" id="1b98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the photograph below, we see his historic meeting with Rockefeller. Rothschild was not simply meeting with Rockefeller to exchange friendly greetings. Rothschild met with Rockefeller to announce that the Rothschild Investment Trust was purchasing a 40% share in the Rockefeller Family Fund. Rockefeller behind the EC; Rothschild behind Rockefeller. Truly, as Lenin said, the capitalists are “really just one big capitalist.”</p><p name="cc38" id="cc38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Standing with these two men at this meeting was the Jewish financer Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg is the former Mayor of New York (2002–2013). He is the single largest political donor in America: he gives quite literally hundreds of millions to Democrats every year, several times more than even the largest PACs and interest lobbies. He ran for President entirely on his own money in 2020, finding more success than Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, and Pete Buttigieg. He promised that “as President” he “will always have Israel’s back and never impose conditions on military aid to them, no matter who is Prime Minister.” Bloomberg was on Epstein’s flight logs, too.</p><p name="ffef" id="ffef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are the ‘innocent’ men who stand behind the nameless faces of the European Commission, like the father of the Euro, Jacques Delors. The UN insists they are not to be suspected by any means. We will not even pretend the UN is simply clueless. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The UN knows exactly what it is doing</em>, and quite simply, they believe the reader is too stupid to see through it.</p><p name="f93f" id="f93f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who is the President of the European Commission today? That would be Ursula von der Leyen. Her father, Ernst Albrecht, was a German aristocrat from the centuries-old Albrecht dynasty; he served as Prime Minister of Saxony and Director-General of the EC. Ursula’s brother, Hans-Holger Albrecht, is the President and CEO of Deezer, a global media conglomerate.</p><p name="9ec6" id="9ec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the right, Leyen shakes hands with the Jewish coke addict and comedian-turned- President, Vladimir “I will make Ukraine into a second Israel” Zelensky (this wa said verbatim by him). If the reader has been falling for all the Ukraine slop, they have probably seen Leyen on TV talking about how it is their duty to sacrifice a warm winter so that the Zelensky can shove “his” nation into the clutches of the EU. Here, we see Leyen and Zelensky pose with a Ukraine flag which has been defaced with the European Union flag. Leyen has just promised to “speed up Ukraine’s EU membership.”</p><figure name="0d63" id="0d63" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*oOTTI5kku_2jtgux" data-width="170" data-height="131" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oOTTI5kku_2jtgux"></figure><p name="69f4" id="69f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To the right, Leyen shakes hands with President Donald Trump at Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum; Schwab’s father, Eugen Schwab, served as an engineer in the Swiss branch of the NSDAP. In Davos, Switzerland, the WEF hosts its invitation-only meetings under strict privacy, with hired mercenary snipers guarding the building premise. Outsiders — fellows like the reader and myself — are not allowed inside, and are only allowed to know as much as the few journalists who are invited wish to share.</p><p name="1890" id="1890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These meetings are attended by nearly all the world’s leading capitalists, royals, politicians, media magnates, academics, and so forth — women like Leyen, men like Trump. The reader is encouraged to look up a roster of WEF attendees for a single year, and they will get the idea. We can give one example: a man who attends nearly every year is Henry Kissinger, who we see pictured with Leyen at the Munich Security Conference in 2014. Kissinger is a Hungarian Jew who immigrated to America after serving in US military intelligence during WWII. He can rightly be called the ‘Prime Minister’ of world government. He is very close with the Rothschild-Rockefeller clique, to nearly every major politician, and to so many NGOs and think-tanks, it is impossible to count them: he is a member not only the WEF, but also the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations, and just about any other big organization the reader can think of.</p><blockquote name="7d1a" id="7d1a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Power has made Kissinger blossom,” reads a 1972 Time article. “Now that he is solidly established as undisputed boss of foreign affairs, he is more relaxed than ever, and he is ostentatiously enjoying himself.”</em></blockquote><p name="6888" id="6888" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">For an idea of Kissinger’s influence, we can glance at a few photographs.</p><figure name="5dc0" id="5dc0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rjVNm_dklvpdR_-b" data-width="400" data-height="294" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rjVNm_dklvpdR_-b"></figure><figure name="e31a" id="e31a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ur8mBxqQ98-0zO7O" data-width="433" data-height="380" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ur8mBxqQ98-0zO7O"></figure><figure name="36de" id="36de" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*RbwcnbF2R83M7nkO" data-width="402" data-height="528" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RbwcnbF2R83M7nkO"></figure><p name="ecca" id="ecca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The UN mentioned two other organizations behind their anti- “conspiracy theory” campaign. The first of these is Twitter, and since this is literally a massive for- profit social media empire, it would seem condescending to the reader for us to explain how this group does not act in the public interest. Let us just briefly highlight the fact. Twitter’s Chairman is Bret Taylor. Taylor comes from Stanford University, one of the most elite academic institutions in the world. In 2005, he co-created Google Maps: and if the reader knows anything about the history of Google’s map software, they will know it was designed in coordination with In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s official technology firm. Taylor is now CEO of Salesforce, a California tech company founded by Jewish financier Marc Benioff, a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum (he is on the WEF’s board of trustees) who served on President George Bush’s Information Technology Advisory Committee in 2003. Benioff also helped co- found the Earthshot Prize with the UK’s Prince William, and his cousin, David Benioff, is the creator of Game of Thrones — entertainment media is nothing but another arm of monopoly, you see.</p><p name="f201" id="f201" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, finally, we come to the last organization: the World Jewish Congress. It should be said that if one is trying to convince the world that Jews do not have an inordinate amount of influence among global politics, even mentioning the WJC is probably the single worst idea imaginable. This cabal is so well-connected that even other Jews frequently denounce its influence.</p><blockquote name="aa2e" id="aa2e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The World Jewish Congress’s actions are an extraordinary infamy,” wrote the Jew Bruno Kreisky, former Chancellor of Austria, in reference to the WJC”s interference in Austria’s 1986 elections. “Austrians won’t allow foreign Jews to order us around.”</em></blockquote><p name="dda5" id="dda5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The WJC’s founder, Nahum Goldmann, held citizenship to seven different countries, including (of course) the US and Israel. He was a passionate cosmopolitan, and the WJC today brags of how he helped set up a secret network of political contacts throughout the synagogues of the USSR to conduct anti-communist agitation, which proved invaluable to the eventual rise of Gorbachev.</p><blockquote name="791f" id="791f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The WJC is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry,” said Goldmann. “It will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.”</em></blockquote><p name="8b48" id="8b48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">They are “entitled” to speak on behalf of all the Jews, says Goldmann. More recently, the WJC’s Executive Director, Elan Steinberg, said:</p><blockquote name="6c9c" id="6c9c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, using quiet diplomacy. Now we’re less timid, more forcefully Jewish.”</em></blockquote><p name="6cba" id="6cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Now, what exactly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is </em>the WJC? The WJC is exactly what the name suggests: a congress designed to unite <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all </em>the Jews in the world under a single global state (initially “meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life”). When we say “all the Jews”, we mean <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all of them</em>. If one is “of Jewish blood”, then no matter where they live, save for an extremely limited number of countries, then there is a WJC branch near them, and it will seek them out. This branch will take their vote on matters of global Jewish leadership and policy. These votes are not at all meaningless: they are officially counted in the state elections of Israel, and in the elections for the leadership of big synagogues and Jewish activist NGOs.

He is good friends with the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Argentine President Cristina de Kirchner, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Anzar, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and, naturally, with Henry Kissinger.

And, since our organization is very strong and has a lot of money, and the ties between Israel and the American Jewish establishment are very strong — they have power, as you know, which is okay, they are talented people — and they have power and money and media and other things. And their attitude is about their Israeli identity. They are not ready to hear criticism. It’s very easy to blame critics as anti-Semites and to bring up the Holocaust.

Bill Gates is a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Malthusian</em>. He believes the world has too many people, i.e. it is “overpopulated”. He once infamously put out a video on overpopulation titled: “Does saving more lives lead to overpopulation?” His “Giving Pledge” was originally “the Good Club”, a eugenicist secret society.

Merely weeks before COVID was “discovered”, Gates coupled with the WEF and John Hopkins University to study a simulation of a pandemic. Everything that happened during the COVID outbreak and vaccine rollout was discussed at this event, as if with foresight. The reader can look into it if they wish. The other man we wish to look at, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIHIAD) and was more or less the 32 leader of the COVID response in America. Look up Fauci’s name, reader: you will see the media in full force extolling him, defending him from every accuser and critic, kissing his feet and praising his holy name — indeed, they even made a documentary about him during the pandemic. Who is this Dr. Fauci? Dr. Fauci’s life has been wrought with many infamous episodes, including (but not limited to) being accused of deliberately misinforming people during the AIDS epidemic to such a degree that it killed thousands more than if he had just kept quiet; carrying out a bizarre experiment which involved torturing dogs with infected flies and then killing them, all funded on taxpayer money; claiming that “arguing against me is arguing against science”; committing perjury and then officially changing the NIHIAD’s definition of “gain-of-function research” to retroactively nullify his perjury; and much, much more.</p><p name="1c09" id="1c09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our general point regarding Fauci, the leader of the American COVID response, can be made very concisely by providing four sources.

He then went in public and asserted there was no proof whatsoever that the disease was manmade, then accused the Chinese of making it, then went back to insisting it began in animals, and now he acknowledges it may have begun in a lab, but that he’s not sure.

After the first couple of times, you get used to it, and it stops stinging. But if one lights off a firecracker in their closed fist, it will quite literally blow their hand off in a gory mess, bits of flesh and blood splattering across their face. The UN demands the reader close his fist around the firecracker, so that the sparks don’t set off all the gunpowder they’ve left at their own feet. Those who fall for this command don’t really end up stopping the fire: they just learn a quick, painful lesson.</p><p name="90d9" id="90d9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How Can Journalists Report on Conspiracy Theories?”</p><figure name="9438" id="9438" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*4GtO2Oqcptqis-9U" data-width="296" data-height="386" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4GtO2Oqcptqis-9U"></figure><p name="9944" id="9944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There is one more UN infographic, titled “How can journalists report on conspiracy theories?” It is mostly redundant.

If the journalists actually did this, the reader would’ve already known about everything written in this essay (but I almost guarantee they did not).

They make sure to viciously attack the idea as wrong, delusional, etc., before they introduce us to what the idea actually is.

A baseless, thoroughly bourgeois campaign meant to dissuade the masses from understanding the incompatibility of their own existence with the existence of the Rothschild, Rockefeller, etc. cartels. There is no <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">theory </em>of conspiracy; there is merely the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fact</em>. The world is run by profiteers. Those that defend the world order expect to turn a profit. How does the worker vote Baron Rothschild out of his position of influence? In what way can the worker vote that will end up with Baron Rothschild being put in an electric chair? The simple answer: there isn’t one, hasn’t ever been one, and never will be one. A state run by Baron Rothschild will not put Baron Rothschild in the electric chair, no more than the Ancien Regime would send King Louis to the guillotine. Indeed, the state is there precisely to prevent such a thing from occurring. As to how that problem is resolved, I will leave the reader to figure out on their own.</p><p name="665b" id="665b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2/9/2022 J.
