EU generating zero incomes, this so called “stimulus plan” is nothing but yet another racket of Nation State by the European Union, that will distribute this money once again totally arbitrarily and favorising some industrial sector, some countries, &amp; some market against some others. This event show clearly the limits of the “invisible hand’, of the “open, free and fair competition &amp; market”, of the self regulatory myth, the superiority of the market (private sector) over the state (public sector), that underlie the whole neoliberalism scam.</p><p name="ca79" id="ca79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When confronted to real structural problem, the market will always turn itself toward the only legitimate actor of national economical life, the State. Thus, the contradiction that was one of, if not the main, motor of development of western countries; become more and more both inept and proved as the scam it is to the greater masses of people, that are more and more against undemocratic, reactionary construction such as the EU, which is something is reflected in the different election that take place both at a national or supranational level, in which we could have seen a rise in anti EU party these pasts years, that are mostly far right &amp; fascist parties unfortunately. In this regards, we can only be highly critical of the position of a lot of European Communists Party, that remain compromised in their Eurocommunism logic, that is that somehow the European Union is reformable and could become more “social”, more “democratic” or more “progressist”.</p><p name="952b" id="952b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This scam only is yet another clear proof that a lot of Communist Party are beyond any hope of reform, that are not realist and viable option for most of us and moreover for the greater mass of the working class of Europe. With the sanitary crisis which led to the economical crisis that exacerbated the pre existing political one, that is nothing but the legacy of 2005 failed referendum, and of 2008 economical crisis, it’s time to turn ourselves toward French national scene to see more concretely how this translate in people’s life, after making a short rapport of the European situation during the covid crisis.</p><h3 name="0203" id="0203" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">• Covid situation/overview of the sanitary situation around Europe:</h3><p name="2cf2" id="2cf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">First, we will make a quick rapport of the sanitary crisis situation in Europe, <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" data-href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">using JHU CSSE data</a>, consulted in <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" data-href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">this dashboard.</a></p><p name="c4cb" id="c4cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Europe is the second most affected continent of the world, with <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">more than 20 million of cases</strong> (France representing 3.5M of cases) and it was the first before the US of A take the lead, not so long ago, and there’s no wonder why. Under European Union rule, most of the nation state had to privatize, reform, remodel their social security and hospital sectors, cutting State funding, in the name of the austerity measure that followed 2008 crisis, and also of the EU neoliberal dogma that consider nationalized sector as “social dumping”. Slowly but surely, many Nation State did sabotage their own hospital sector, their own capacity of producing medicine, their own social security service, and all those neoliberal measure are being paid nowadays, once again by the same, the people of each nation.</p><p name="6808" id="6808" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some may be tempted to think that it’s not the case in their own country, that they did benefits from the European Union, that somehow they’re better having a positive balance in the amount of € injected by the European Council in their economy, but those people may have to remember History, most of those countries are actually Eastern Europe countries, those who were socialist in the past, and their current national situation isn’t somewhat good because others Western/South European countries are paying the hard price, it still is far away from the common benefits they all enjoyed from their socialists Era; and to be convinced of it, they simply have to analysis the exemplar management of the Covid by actual socialist country, from Vietnam to China, from Cuba to North Korea.This is not an opinion, this is all facts, and it should be accepted as such by everyone, once and for all, if we want to not only get out of the current Covid crisis, but also be prepared for the next pandemic that we may face sooner than later. To show more in depth those facts, and to highlight more the reality on the ground, we will now advance and see two main points: How the French government manage the crisis in its early time (the first few months) not strictly on the legal level, which consisted mostly of setting up two lockdown, one from the 17th March to the 11th May; another one from the 30th October to the 15th December, along with two curfews effective from the 17th March, which was mostly decided by local authority and wasn’t strict sensus a government initative, and a second curfew, this one a generalized one pushed by the government, at first covering 54 departement of France, effective from the 17th October to this day. This second curfew, that is still effective, was initially set up from 21h to 6h; but was extend to the point we’re in today, which is from 18h to 6h, a total inepty that actually that actually push people to go home fast before 18h, or to do their shopping, leading to some peak in the metro or supermarket… Now that we have deal with the general measure, let’s take the exemple of the ex-minister of health, Agnès Buzyn, and see how the government deployed his propaganda machine more in the details.</p><h3 name="0706" id="0706" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">• Management of the crisis by the French government’s official</h3><p name="c1d4" id="c1d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the first month of 2020, government official and minister were trying to persuade the population that we were not facing a real risk of pandemic. Probably the greatest example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agn%C3%A8s_Buzyn" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agn%C3%A8s_Buzyn" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">Agnès Buzyn</a>, that said<a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/coronavirus-en-france-les-risques-de-propagation-du-virus-dans-la-population-sont-tres-faibles-selon-agnes-buzyn_VN-202001240157.html" data-href="https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/coronavirus-en-france-les-risques-de-propagation-du-virus-dans-la-population-sont-tres-faibles-selon-agnes-buzyn_VN-202001240157.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">, the 24 January</a>, that “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the importation of covid case from Wuhan is moderate. It is now almost null because, as you know, the city is isolated</em>”. The following development will be treated in chronological order of event as much as possible, and will focus on her, which make sens in my opinion, given the context of the crisis.</p><p name="297f" id="297f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxjdLA4GsFg" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxjdLA4GsFg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">She said 2 days later</a> (18:40) that France authorities had “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dozen of millions of mask in stock in case of sanitary emergency, so all this is perfectly managed by the authorities, and if one days we shall need to wear a mask, [they] would distribute those mask and there would be absolutely no reason to go buy them in pharmacy</em>”</p><p name="4001" id="4001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 14 february, to the question, could we fear to have dead from coronavirus in France, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpx-0z6sc6k" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpx-0z6sc6k" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">she answered</a> (4:20) : “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Today, I can’t affirm it, but, seeing the severity of the pandemy in China, seeing the number of case in South East Asia, it is really probable that we will have new cases, I cannot say that we won’t have some, and so, even if they don’t necessarily come from China, we can see that there is a circulation of the virus in different territory, and so we are ready, we continue this strategy of spotting and isolating case, there are now more and more hospital in France that have at their disposition tests, we are testing many dozen of people that come from China and who have symptom. […] For now all those tests are negative, but I cannot be certain that we won’t have case in the incoming weeks</em>.”</p><p name="23d4" id="23d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">17 february, Agnes Buzyn resign from her Minister position, to be the new candidate of LREM (Macron party) in the run for Paris Mayor position, following the scandal that ejected out of the election her party last candidate, Griveaux.</p><p name="59e2" id="59e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As soon as 3 of March, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zNsQKXaHp4" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zNsQKXaHp4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">on a TV scene</a>, she repeated that she has done the necessary to be sure that everything is ready for the pandemic, she has bought and ordered masks, respirators, preparing reanimation service in hospital, and this, month before.</p><p name="3614" id="3614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">17 March, the tone of Buzyn has changed. She just lost the election, had no more official position, and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2020/03/17/entre-campagne-municipale-et-crise-du-coronavirus-le-chemin-de-croix-d-agnes-buzyn_6033395_823448.html" data-href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2020/03/17/entre-campagne-municipale-et-crise-du-coronavirus-le-chemin-de-croix-d-agnes-buzyn_6033395_823448.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">she began to open the Pandora box.</a></p><p name="315b" id="315b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During her speech when she resigned of her minister position, she cried, which was seen as kind of over reacting from a lot of commenters at the time. But the reality is that Buzyn, in her own words, was crying because she was aware of the incoming catastrophe, which also included the murderous fact of keeping the municipal election ongoing during the outbreak of a pandemic, meaning that the State will manage the gathering of large crowd of people while knowing perfectly the risk taken in the midst of the Covid crisis. She admit in this article that she was perfectly aware of the drama that this pandemic would be for French society, and that the worst part was to know the sanitary risks and yet to run for the election nonetheless. She says that “she spent the whole election time [which was super short because she replace the main candidate only in the last weeks] in fear, and that the worst was the last week [the one before the 16 march], that she lived as a real nightmare [because she was aware of the consequences of running an election in the middle of the first wave of pandemic outbreak]. She admitted that she warned the government <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">as soon as early January.</strong></p><p name="09ee" id="09ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quoting: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I think I was the first one to see what was happening in China. I sent to the General Director of Health. The 11th January I sent a message to Macron about the situation. The 30th January I warned Edouard Phillipe (PM) that the election probably couldn’t happen. When I left the Minister, I was crying because I knew the tsunami wave was in front of us. There will be thousands of deaths</em>.”</p><p name="426b" id="426b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could have developed on a lot of her others lies, but this would add too much length to the post for not much, so I will flash forward in time, to the moment when Buzyn was confronted by the “Commission d’Enquête de l’assemblée nationale”, the parliament investigation commission; she once again repeated the usual lies, and went even more far: She said that the anticipation work done by the government was awesome, that as a Health Minister she wasn’t in charge ot the masks stock, and that the fact that the State knew since October 2018 that a huge stock of the products they had were obsolete and needed to be renewed and that it has not been done, was indeed rising legitimate question. When directly confronted to her own words on the 17 March article where she admitted it all, she simply said that “she was exhausted” after the Election Day…</p><p name="f768" id="f768" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In brief, the farce was back on track at his highest level of self contradictory claims, lies, mismanagement, careerism, and murderous inepties.</p><p name="a5c9" id="a5c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It will be worth mentioning that she is the one who putted hydroxichloroquin as a “venomous product” thru M. Salomon, another figure that would have been worth to analyse too, and who got confronted by the parliament too. <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2020/1/13/SSAP2001007A/jo/texte" data-href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2020/1/13/SSAP2001007A/jo/texte" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">Here is the text that classified the medicine.</a></p><p name="5b02" id="5b02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For those who may have concern about Mrs. Buzyn career, I want to reassure them, she’s now working at the World Health Organization, more specifically for its Director-General, as she has been “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">appointed as [his] envoy for relations with other multilateral organizations</strong>”. That’s what you get as a reward for mismanaging, lying, deceiving, betraying, and being responsible of the death of dozens of thousands of people in a proper dictatorship of the bourgeoisie like France is.</p><p name="299a" id="299a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now that we have seen the French government propaganda campain, and its first measure, albeit only briefly, let’s advance toward a more concrete, real analysis, which is the analysis of the economical situation in Europe and in France, and the measures took by the government to fight the pandemic.</p><h3 name="f2c7" id="f2c7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">• Economical situation &amp; recession in the EU Zone:</h3><p name="cf16" id="cf16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><a href="https://preview.redd.it/1kwy2by1c3i61.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba1ac5bf27cf90f86c2076ff8231141025ae1fe" data-href="https://preview.redd.it/1kwy2by1c3i61.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba1ac5bf27cf90f86c2076ff8231141025ae1fe" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">The extent of the recession in European countries</a></p><p name="a2a3" id="a2a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s see the economical situation in the EU zone, using <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10545332/2-14082020-AP-EN.pdf/7f30c3cf-b2c9-98ad-3451-17fed0230b57" data-href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10545332/2-14082020-AP-EN.pdf/7f30c3cf-b2c9-98ad-3451-17fed0230b57" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">this PDF from Eurostat from 14th August 2020</a>.</p><p name="cf24" id="cf24" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“GDP and employment flash estimates for the second quarter of 2020 GDP down by 12.1% and employment down by 2.8% in the euro area.

We have quickly seen the stimulus plan that consisted in injecting a certain amount of € in national economy, but even if this 750 billions of € seems massive, it’s actually really nothing when compared to EU GDP that is around 12k billions €, and more over, those injection aren’t done to increase production, to maintain employment, or to secures some strategical industrial sector, not at all, in fact it is the opposite. They actually are there to accelerate the mass firing plan of many industries, and to secure the investment of shareholder and pension fund in a lot of European country.

Simple, they threatened France to allow Chinese company to invest massively in their action if the state doesn’t comply. Have in mind that the main shareholder of Air France is the French State, with 14.3% of the actions. Which mean that the mechanism that allow company to exerce on national soil is not “broke” or anything, it is by design what cut Nation State hand of any power on their own market and industrial sector, and this is the European Union system. I will illustrate with the other main sector in France that was focus by the Stimulus plan that is the automobile sector. <a href="https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/20200526_DP_Automobile.pdf" data-href="https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/20200526_DP_Automobile.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">Here is the document that I will use and quote.</a></p><p name="1c6b" id="1c6b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“La crise sanitaire liée au COVID-19 a porté un coup d’arrêt massif et brutal à l’ensemble de la filière automobile française.

But you understand, they have to secures fund to pay dividend, and investment in production development, or, let’s dream, in salary rise, are a blocking factor for that.</p><p name="7d90" id="7d90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a whole process that is the consequence of a phenomenon some economist call the great decoupling, that is, in super short, that dividend part of the benefits repartition exploded since the 2000s, while % of investment and % of redistribution of the plus value not only stagnated but decreased. The “traditional” repartition was 1/3 for investment, 1/3 for dividend, and 1/3 for salary, exploded, and now it’s mostly dividend that increase while the two other pole slowed down. This is nothing but yet another proof of the increased attack on labor from the capital side that happened at a massively increased rate those past few decades. <a href="https://www.smallbizlabs.com/2015/03/what-is-the-great-decoupling.html" data-href="https://www.smallbizlabs.com/2015/03/what-is-the-great-decoupling.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">Here is a quick explanation of Great decoupling</a>:</p><p name="b0fc" id="b0fc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“The Great Decoupling is a term some economists use to describe the economic decoupling of productivity, wages, jobs and GDP growth. These 4 factors used to move more or less in unison. Starting around 2000 the growth in labor productivity “decoupled” from job growth. Labor productivity and GDP growth has also decoupled from median household income. In other words, a growing economy and increases in labor productivity are no longer leading to as many new jobs or as much wage growth as in the past.</em> “</p><p name="9534" id="9534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xulz8zscc3i61.jpg?width=1021&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75280fe24756589adaba996053b7bcd2c298e12a" data-href="https://preview.redd.it/xulz8zscc3i61.jpg?width=1021&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75280fe24756589adaba996053b7bcd2c298e12a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">US example of the Great Decoupling effect</a></p><p name="37ab" id="37ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coming back to the France scene (but it’s general in the whole EU zone as seen in past report) and to the reality of 2020, we can only notice here these investment aren’t here to secures production, by passing order to those industrial sector for instance, nor to secures employment at all, but only to secures the shareholder investment in some company that are leading the financial sector of some nation, like the automobile or aeronautic sector of France, by securizing their valuation on the auction market, and not by securizing their production line and their workers. If tomorrow Renault went to fire French workers and outsource its factory outside of France borders, those state aids won’t even be a counterweight for the French state to block them to do so, nor the 14.3% of actions that French state has in Air France. We simply are, pardon my French, wiping their ass and allowing them to avoid their responsibility, and this is all in accordance with European Union policies of management of Covid crisis.</p><p name="b9db" id="b9db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we can see clearly here, the very same people who were crying a few years ago about “unfair state monopole”, about “social dumping”, about “market bareer”, and kept calling for the golden rule, who advocated for austerity measure and mass privatization of public service, not only created the condition of the current covid crisis, thru the forced weakening of public hospital sector, of medicine production one, of social security service in the name of neoliberalism, but are now the very same people who are injecting € directly into economical sector, and massively, and this without any guarantee for the employment, who, on the contrary, are literally funding mass firing plan.</p><p name="9dfc" id="9dfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those who in the name of free and fair market competition destroyed the capacity of Nation state to intervene on their own soil, are the very same people that now advocate not only for the opposite, for direct and massive intervention in economy, but are also securizing capitalist interest thru this “stimulus plan” investment, by giving them freely what is citizen money, but also by paying partial salary for them; doing investment in their place, and allowing them to mass firing and social plan, when they are perfectly aware of the long term choc that this crisis will create.</p><p name="d8c9" id="d8c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The contradiction of neoliberalism being made this clear and obvious to everyone, it’s only a matter of time before this reflect in the political scene. People will not understand or accept that their companies are allowed to fire people en masse, and worst, receive money for doing so, while their state is not allowed to have even a decent and functional public hospital sector in the middle of a sanitary &amp; economical crisis such as the covid one. The effect of these policies risk to be even higher in political terms than it will be in economical one. But that’s unfortunately an aspect of the crisis that I won’t be able to treat, because this report that was supposed to be short is already too long, and kind of dense, so I will have to conclude it here.</p><h3 name="8503" id="8503" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion:</h3><p name="eaec" id="eaec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As we have seen, the neoliberal construction that the European Union is, not only got shaken to its core once again, but this time, to an unprecedented level. The crisis exacerbated the pre-existing structural problems that plagues the EU since its beginning, the supranationality aspect of the Union, the neoliberal dogma that is the core of its policies &amp; infrastructure, the constent weakening of the nation-state members public service of the pasts decades, the schengen-space, the limits of its institutions, amongst many others things. All those points, that every liberal seems to take for granted for years, were profoundly undermined, and a lot of “concession” had to be made by the European Council, the ECB, etc…</p><p name="ccaf" id="ccaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This had as an immediate effect to highlight the fact that the neoliberal dogma that underlie the whole European Union since its very beginning is nothing but a scam, but also to highlight the character of Class Warfare of it. Indeed, as we have seen, even in such critical time, everyone could have seen what were the first priority of the ruling class, and how they used the crisis to cynically develop evermore their own political agenda, and what could be seen as concession, as a recoil, is in fact a good pretext to mobilize the nation-state in their own interests. But the consequences of the recession will be dramatic, very dramatic.</p><p name="9de0" id="9de0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And we shall not be fooled, this will be the only result of the crisis if there’s no progressives forces to voice up their critical analysis, to fight yet again what is another hold-up from the financial world and its lackey, the ruling class, against what is the legitimate tool of the great masses, their nation-state. We’re not in Lenin time anymore, and the most recent development of capitalism and imperialism, which is neoliberalism, should have us concerned about the defense of the nation-state.</p><p name="9793" id="9793" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We already can notice that the <a href="https://lesfrancais.press/le-fmi-note-la-france-sans-conviction/" data-href="https://lesfrancais.press/le-fmi-note-la-france-sans-conviction/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">FMI is back on track and begin to pressurize France</a> to take a certain numbers of measures, and very literally warn the world that that some countries will have to <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/covid-19-la-dette-mondiale-proche-de-100-du-pib-alerte-le-fmi-20210128" data-href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/covid-19-la-dette-mondiale-proche-de-100-du-pib-alerte-le-fmi-20210128" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc noopener" target="_blank">“set up a credible mid-term budgetary framework”</a> because the worldwide public debt level is reaching 100% of the world GDP. Therefore our duty, us communists, is double, and consist in conducting two things: First a proper analysis of the ongoing event, otherwise we shall not be surprised to not be able to fulfill our second duty, which is to lead the fight in the incoming Class Warfare that the post-covid situation will lead us in. We are facing a precipice, and I cannot help myself but notice that most of us are unprepared in the fight that is awaiting us in the incoming decade.</p><p name="6070" id="6070" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Study, study &amp; study, comrades. A concrete analysis of a concrete situation is what is needed, because without it, we will not be able to do draft a proper theoretical theory and so, we won’t ever be able to have a proper praxis, and how to call ourselves the vanguard of the working class if we’re not able to have a proper praxis? How are we supposed to lead the fight that awaits us if we cannot first organize ourselves?</p><p name="74f3" id="74f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the 2010s was already pretty harsh for all the partisan of Europe, I cannot stress out enough how much harder will be the 2020s decade. And this time, we need to be prepared and organized, because the issue of this fight could be one of the most decisive issue for the people not only of Europe, but of the world. Because the situation is not brighter across the Atlantic, because such a weakening of the Empire may not come again anytime soon; and because all this happen while a light is shining brightly in the East, giving us a proper lesson on how to manage the covid crisis, it is now up to us to transform the essay and to reverse the trend. If it mean that we need to drop any hope for the Eurocommunist party, that are suffering of the senile disease of communism, and to begin to build our own party from scratch, then be it. If it mean to push for reforming the traditionally communist syndicate, then be it. If it mean to bear the contradiction &amp; the critical speech everywhere, every time, then be it. We cannot and we shall not afford to be defeatist in such a period. We cannot and we shall not afford another decade such as the one that just passed.</p><blockquote name="c6a7" id="c6a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The building of a fighting organisation and the conduct of political agitation are essential under any “drab, peaceful” circumstances, in any period, no matter how marked by a “declining revolutionary spirit”; moreover, it is precisely in such periods and under such circumstances that work of this kind is particularly necessary, since it is too late to form the organisation in times of explosion and outbursts; the party must be in a state of readiness to launch activity at a moment’s notice.</em></blockquote><p name="f79e" id="f79e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">V.I Lenin — Where to begin? — May 1901</p></div></div></section>
