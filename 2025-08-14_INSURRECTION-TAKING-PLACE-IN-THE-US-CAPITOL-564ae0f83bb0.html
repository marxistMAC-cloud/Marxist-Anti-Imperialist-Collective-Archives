The GOP is breaking apart, the US nations are starting to break apart too. The imperialists were not able to give them a bigger piece of the pie than before, and the incompetent Trump administration was just the cherry at the top, since it allowed all contradictions in US to flourish like a beautiful flower.</p><p name="4dd3" id="4dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, what happened?</p><p name="709a" id="709a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On January 5, Trumpists gathered in the US Capitol to protest the inauguration of Biden. Trump continued to speak about fraud, and vice-president Pence broke with Trump since he supported Biden’s inauguration. A swarm of protesters ranging from Trumpists to white nationalists like the Proud Boys assaulted the US Capitol. They managed to capture areas of it, one person was wounded by a gun shot in the chest. About 10 were captured.</p><p name="7247" id="7247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every liberal, ranging from the Democrats and</p><p name="b170" id="b170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Republicans, swarmed the media and told the people of USA:</p><p name="95f9" id="95f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">«We need to stay united, Republicans and Democrats should work together, we are one nation after all», etc., etc.</p><p name="452f" id="452f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, this shows what we outlined in previous articles. The reason why the ruling class hates Trump is not because of the man, but because of the movement.</p><p name="a300" id="a300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like Biden said two months ago, the only thing that can kill America is America itself.</p><p name="7373" id="7373" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Biden calls this an Insurrection.</p><p name="74df" id="74df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">January 6, Trump makes a public speech. Something important happens, because while Trump does not accept defeat, he tells the protesters to go home.</p><p name="6c5e" id="6c5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One would figure, what will the white nationalists think now?</p><p name="4a60" id="4a60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They will think (hopefully) that the GOP and Trump are nothing more than parts of the system itself. That they don’t care about the white nation.</p><p name="2ca2" id="2ca2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once this gets to the white nationalists heads, they will start to organize outside of the establishment.</p><p name="e17d" id="e17d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day of this happening is near. White nationalists already have organized out of the establishment, but they are on the fringe. In the following months they are bound to multiply their numbers of disillusioned white nationalists who were once loyal to GOP.</p><p name="7d80" id="7d80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right now, there are only two ways for the USA.</p><p name="cfd7" id="cfd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Either civil war, taking the form of national liberation wars; the black nation creates a state in the southeast, the Chicanos are given the Southwest and create Aztlan, the various natives get their states too, and the rest is made in a warring smaller states between white nationalists and American nationalists who favor how US currently is.</p><p name="df8e" id="df8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or, the US bourgeoisie manage to bring the white nationalists on board with the «American nation» project.</p><p name="f14b" id="f14b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only way for this to happen is by quickly giving them bigger shares of the imperialist pie. This means more, and stronger, imperialism.</p><p name="78a5" id="78a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How did Europe react? The cosmopolitan bourgeoisie Europeans rushed to the political aid of the Democrats and the US ruling class, condemning the insurrection.</p><p name="93fb" id="93fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is expected, to be honest. How did the US «communists» (CPUSA) react?</p><p name="d41f" id="d41f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By calling the victory of the Democrats a victory for the people. Indeed, it is a victory for the American labor aristocracy. And likewise, a defeat for the global proletariat. This was also to be expected from one group of the «left» flank of US imperialism.</p><p name="da51" id="da51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other big communist party, PSL, has not yet commended to our knowledge.</p><p name="27e2" id="27e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for where the correct communist line lies? Let the potential president of global fascism, Joe Biden, give the answer.</p><p name="4c02" id="4c02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">«Nothing can kill America, except America itself.»</p><p name="1298" id="1298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, since we deem his understanding of the situation a very correct one, we get behind his view and we apply it.</p><p name="15d1" id="15d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Only America can kill its fake self.</p><p name="ecf6" id="ecf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Power to the nationalists who want to break it into 100 pieces!</p><p name="173e" id="173e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">F.
