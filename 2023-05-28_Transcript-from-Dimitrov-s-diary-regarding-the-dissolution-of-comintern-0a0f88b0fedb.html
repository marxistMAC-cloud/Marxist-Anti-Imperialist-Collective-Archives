Z. [Manuilsky] and I discussed the grounds for the resolution to discontinue the activities of the ECCI. A great many unclear and difficult issues connected with that restructuring. -In the CC (to see Zhdanov).</p><p name="3c12" id="3c12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We discussed the question of the Comintern.</p><p name="074c" id="074c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1.The resolution must be grounded in principle, for we will have some serious explaining to do abroad as well as among our own Soviet Communists as regards why such a step is being taken. There used to be a Comintern with its own considerable history; then suddenly it ceases to exist and function as a united international center.</p><p name="878b" id="878b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* In the resolution, all possible blows by the enemy ought to be anticipated, for instance, that this is supposedly a mere maneuver, or that the Communists are rejecting internationalism and the international proletarian revolution.</p><p name="9aa4" id="9aa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* Our argumentation should evoke enthusiasm in the Communists parties, rather than create a funereal mood and dismay.</p><p name="256f" id="256f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">* It should be pointed out that the essential thing at this stage is not to direct the movement in various countries from a single international center, but rather to put the primary emphasis on the movement and its leadership in each individual country, to develop fully the independence of Communist parties that are themselves capable of leading the workers’ movement in their respective countries, themselves capable of devising their own strategy, tactics, and organization and bearing full responsibility for the workers’ movement in their own countries, of relying utterly and completely on their own strength and capabilities.</p><p name="cca0" id="cca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">*We will have to develop the idea of combining a healthy, properly understood nationalism with proletarian internationalism. Proletarian internationalism should be grounded in such a nationalism in the individual countries. Comrade Stalin made it clear that between nationalism properly understood and proletarian internationalism there can be no contradictions. Rootless cosmopolitanism that denies national feelings and the notion of a homeland has nothing in common with proletarians internationalism. Such cosmopolitanism paves the way for the recruitment of spies, enemy agents.</p><p name="9d64" id="9d64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">*The ideas of the Communist International have penetrated deeply into the progressive strata of the working class in the capitalists countries. At the present stage it is necessary for the Communist parties to work as independent national parties. It is on the basis of a flourishing national Communist movement in the individual countries that an international Communist organization will be reborn at the following stage on an even stronger and broader base.</p><p name="c35e" id="c35e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">*It must be clearly demonstrated that discontinuing the activities of the ECCI is not tantamount to rejecting international proletarian solidarity. On the contrary, it is only its forms and methods of manifesting itself that are changing to forms and methods more appropriate to the current stage of the international workers’ movement.</p><p name="8898" id="8898" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. This step is to be entirely serious and consistent. It should not be taken in such a way that only the trappings, one could say, are being changed, but everything else remains the same-that is, the ECCI is disbanded, but in fact an international directing center continues to exist in a different guise.</p><p name="586b" id="586b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. It matters a great deal on whose initiative this is to be done: on the leadership’s own initiative or on the proposal of a number of Communist parties. It seems the latter would be better.</p><p name="54d6" id="54d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. The matter is not so urgent: there is no need to rush; instead, discuss the matter seriously and prepare. Three questions ought to be discussed: a) How to ground the resolution in principle b) On whose initiative the resolution is to be adopted c) The legacy of the CI-what next?</p><p name="d093" id="d093" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. In any case, the Communist movement can reap great benefits from this step: a) All anti-Comintern pacts immediately lose all grounds. b) The bourgeoisie’s highest trump card, that the Communists are subjects of a foreign center, hence “traitors,” will be taken away. c) The Communist Party in each country will strengthen its independence and turn into an authentic national party of its country. d) Joining Communists parties will become easier for the worker activists who currently choose not to join, out of the belief that, by doing so, they alienate themselves from their own peoples.</p><p name="5550" id="5550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Source : the Diary of Georgi Dimitrov, 12th of May 1941.</p><p name="590e" id="590e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Transcribed by, G.
