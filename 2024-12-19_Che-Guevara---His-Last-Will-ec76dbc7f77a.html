He became the object of a certain romanticism on the part of the entire progressive and patriotic world of the oppressed, becoming, like Christ, a figure of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lamb</em>, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Innocent</em>.Nietzsche, as a petty bourgeois reaction to the rise of monopolistic capitalism (there is a reason why this denunciation of slave morality is also an upper-class one, in this Hegelian master-slave dialectic), already spoke of it brilliantly:</p><blockquote name="4c65" id="4c65" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Lambs hold grudges against the great birds of prey, which is not surprising: but that is no reason to hold it against the great birds of prey for catching the little lambs. But if these lambs say to each other: “These birds of prey are wicked; and he who is as little greedy as possible, who is rather the opposite, a lamb, would he not be good?”, then there is nothing to object to this construction of an ideal, even if the birds of prey must view this with a somewhat mocking eye and perhaps say to themselves: “We hold no grudge against these good lambs, and we even love them: nothing is less tasty than a tender lamb. “ </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">To demand that strength not manifest itself as strength, that it not be the will to dominate, the will to overthrow, the will to master, the thirst for enemies, for resistance and triumph, is just as absurd as to demand that weakness manifest itself as strength.</em></strong></blockquote><p name="7762" id="7762" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">With this eulogy of weakness, the New Man, Che, no longer exists, and is replaced by the messiah Che, the idol of the mediocre and the weak. The name Guevara is divorced from his writings and thoughts, except for vague exclamations and quotes that can be used by almost anyone claiming to be “leftist”. One might even wonder whether this constant eulogy of this former medical student was the first serious attempt to transform communism into an identity for young petty-bourgeois students, into a reified and commodified <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">product</em> ,communism becoming a fan community (of course, it is quite complicated to transform communist theory into Star Wars/DC Comics, because the theory requires an activity of reflection, hard-hard to make Tik Tok videos around the difference between exchange value and use value of labor power, variable capital and constant capital, labor value, primitive accumulation, etc. That’s why influencers are condemned to make sigma videos around historical figures like Stalin).</p><p name="5536" id="5536" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be honest with the readers, this forced the author, a former nationalist Nietzschean converted to Marxism (also exasperated by most leftists waving rainbow flags next to portraits, I admit…), who is writing these lines to you, to despise Che, seeing him as a simple adventurer, denying staying in his real country to build Socialism, to finally commit suicide, understanding that the third-world model was not a magic button that could make us ignore the national question, the main factor of failure in his African escapade. My analysis of Che was quite close to that of Enver Hoxha, in the end, observing in the Argentine theorist a perfect example of what he called the” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">leftist adventurism, product of revisionism</em> “ , which had to be liquidated by a genuine socialist theory.</p><blockquote name="9eb2" id="9eb2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Che Guevara was killed. Such a thing is linkable to happen, because a revolutionary may get killed. Che Guevara, however, was a victim of his own non-Marxist-Leninist views. Who was Che Guevara? When we speak of Che Guevara , we also mean somebody else who poses as a Marxist, in comparison to whom, in our opinion, Che Guevara was a man of fewer words He was a rebel, a revolutionary, but not a Marxist-Leninist as they try. to present him. I may be mistaken that you Latin-Americans are better acquainted with Che Guevara, but I think that he was a leftist fighter His is a bourgeois and petty-bourgeois leftism, combined with some ideas that were progressive, but also anarchist which. , in the final analysis, lead to adventurism The views of Che Guevara and anyone else who poses as a Marxist and claims “paternity” of these ideas have never been or had anything to do with. Marxism- Leninism. Che Guevara also had some “exclairicies” in his adoption of certain Marxist-Leninist principles, but they still did not become a full philosophical world-outlook which could impel him to genuinely revolutionary actions. We cannot say that Che Guevara and his comrades were cowards. No, by no means! On the contrary, they were brave people. There are also bourgeois who are brave men. But the only truly great heroes and truly brave proletarian revolutionaries are those who proceed from the Marxist-Leninist philosophical principles and put all their physical and mental energies at the service of the ´world proletariat for the liberation of the peoples from the yolk of the imperialists, feudal lords and others.</em></blockquote><p name="88a6" id="88a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Therefore I deprived myself of learning things, beyond the superficial aspect of the character, and only read that. I write you these lines with the aim of being clear about the fact that unlike many Trotskyists, Maoists or social democrats, I do not want to try to resurrect a dead man loved by all, because I do not love him beyond his struggle against the United States and his vital role in the construction of a Dictatorship of the Proletariat in Cuba. I have no ambition to take his writings to my own account. Some friends recommended a book to me, which I used as a basis and main source: “Che Guevara: The Economics of Revolution” by Helen Yaffe, published in 2009 in its current edition. Guevara finds himself in opposition to several orthodoxies of Marxism-Leninism.</p><h3 name="86e8" id="86e8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Commodity Production, the Law of Value and Market Mechanisms in the Socialist Mode of Production</h3><p name="511c" id="511c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In common belief, Stalin was very clear about the law of value, the concept of profit, etc. If one reads seriously “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR</em> “ , we see that the analysis of some leftists (particularly Bordiga) and right-wing deviationists (Deng Xiaoping) concerning Stalin’s writings is false. For example, these people will explain to you that Stalin believed in socialist commodity production, which is obviously a gross falsification.</p><p name="f2ac" id="f2ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They forget that his work spoke about the economic problems of Socialism in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">USSR</strong>.Stalin notes that despite the persistence of the law of value and commodity production, socialism continues to be built. He explains this by the presence of two types of property, that belonging to the whole People, embodied in the Workers’ State, and that cooperative, belonging to a group of producers, who are obliged to be linked until the creation of a national property, belonging to the whole society. But all these mechanisms are limited by social property, planning satisfying material and cultural needs.</p><blockquote name="72dc" id="72dc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Why then, one asks, cannot commodity production similarly serve our socialist society for a certain period without leading to capitalism, bearing in mind that in our country commodity production is not so boundless and all-embracing as it is under capitalist conditions, being confined within strict bounds thanks to such decisive economic conditions as social ownership of the means of production, the abolition of the system of wage labor, and the elimination of the system of exploitation (…) The effect of this is that the state disposes only of? the product of the state enterprises, while the product of the collective farms, being their property, is disposed of only by them. But the collective farms are unwilling to alienate their products except in the form of commodities, in exchange for which they desire to receive the commodities they need. collective farms will not recognize any other economic relation with the town except the commodity relation — exchange through purchase and sale. Because of this, commodity production and trade are as much a necessity with us today as they were, say, thirty years ago, when Lenin spoke of the necessity of developing trade to the maximum.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="ccfb" id="ccfb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">But does this mean that the operation of the law of value has as much scope with us as it has under capitalism, and that it is the regulator of production in our country too? No, it does not. Actually, the sphere of operation of the law of value under our economic system is strictly limited and placed within definite bounds. It has already been said that the sphere of operation of commodity production is restricted and placed within definite bounds by our system. of operation of the law of value. fact that private ownership of the means of production does not exist, and that the means of production both in town and country are socialized, cannot but restrict the sphere of operation of the law of value and the extent of its influence on production In this. same direction operates the law of balanced (proportionate) development of the national economy, which has superseded the law of competition and anarchy of production, with yearly plans and our economic policy generally, which are based on the requirements of the law of balanced development of the national economy. The effect of all this, taken together, is that the sphere of operation of the law of value in our country is strictly limited, and that the law of value cannot under our system function as the regulator of production.</em></blockquote><p name="266e" id="266e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But the problem that Che, a great reader of Stalin in spite of everything, understands is: how can we combat this contradiction between cooperative property and state property? How can we find a way to combat these market mechanisms, to break this complicated balance between planning/ social property and the law of value/private property? The answer of Stalin, and of the Soviets behind him, is the love of growth, of productive forces, of technological advances. Charles Bettelheim, describing the race of the 1930s towards collectivization and industrialization, speaks very well of it in his <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Class Struggle in the USSR”</em></p><blockquote name="03dc" id="03dc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">On the plane of ideology, the form taken by the collectivization process — which, in practice, did not put “in command” the task of strengthening the alliance with the poor and middle peasants — was determined by the growing predominance in the Bolshevik Party’s ideology of an “economist- technicist” element. This led to the belief that the difficulties that arose during the last years of the NEP would be solved through the development of modern industry and the transformation of the “technological bases” of production, especially in agriculture. The increasing role ascribed to “technological progress” extended even to ideological and political problems. consequently, recognition of the necessity for ideological and political struggle against the pettybourgeois and individualist ideas existing among the peasantry tended to be replaced by the thesis according to which it would be by the introduction of machinery into agriculture that the “peasant mentality” would be changed”</em></blockquote><p name="64f6" id="64f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Although Bettelheim tries too hard to ignore the many, many times in which Stalin puts politics on the same level as economics (one only has to read Stalin’s writings, in the context of the Great Purges, mocking the Bolsheviks who “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">have been totally absorbed in economic work in recent years, have been engrossed to the limit in economic successes, and being engrossed in all these things forgot about all else, threw aside all else (…) they began to regard this as the beginning and end of everything, and simply gave up paying attention to small things as the international position of the Soviet Uni</em>on, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">capitalist encirclement, strengthening of the political work of the Party, struggle against wrecking, etc., supposing all these questions to be second-rate and even third rate matters</em> “), but it touches on a sensitive point. The priority on consumer goods, abundance at any price, etc. has led to decentralization, liberalization and the destruction of most socialist states.</p><p name="f10d" id="f10d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, to return to what our Argentine genius explains to us, he brilliantly answers the question implicitly raised by the Georgian</p><blockquote name="69ba" id="69ba" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Why develop? We understand that capitalist categories are preserved for a time and that the duration of this period cannot be predetermined, but the characteristics of the transition period are those of a society that is getting rid of its old ties in order to move quickly to the new stage. (…) In our opinion, it would be necessary to eliminate as quickly as possible the old categories, including the market, money and, therefore, material interest — or, better, eliminate the conditions of their existence.” “We deny the possibility of consciously using the law of value, based on the absence of a free market that automatically expresses the contradiction between producers and consumers… The law of value and planning are two terms linked by a contradiction and its resolution. We can therefore affirm that centralized planning is characteristic of socialist society, its definition.</em></blockquote><p name="d6cf" id="d6cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It seems that this Guevara, in the context of the””Great Debate” (The “Great Debate” of 1964 in Cuba refers to a series of discussions that took place between Marxist intellectuals such as Ernest Mandel and Charles Bettelheim, and the Cuban authorities, on how to interpret and apply Marxism in Cuba, particularly with regard to economic planning, the role of the bureaucracy and the nature of the Cuban revolution),tried to regulate as quickly as possible the contradiction, this balance between the remains of the old and the new worlds, by the clear and clean break with the chains of the Laws of Capital. <br>I will leaf through H. Yeffe, page 54.</p><blockquote name="2c28" id="2c28" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Guevara insisted that products transferred between state-owned enterprises do not constitute commodities because there is no change in ownership: ‘We deny the existence of the commodity category in relationships among state enterprises. We consider all such establishments to be part of the single large enterprise that is the State (although in practice this is not yet the case in our country).In expressing our concept of a single enterprise, we based ourselves primarily on Marx’s definition of commodity: “In order to be a commodity , the product has to pass into the hands of a second party, the one who consumes it, by means of an act of exchange.”38 Guevara insisted that commodity-exchange relations between factories threatened transition, via ‘market socialism’, to capitalism He stressed central planning. and state regulation as substitutes to such mechanisms. Cuba, he argued, should be considered as one big factory. Since the law of value does not operate in exchange between state production units, the workers themselves should decide what socialist, non-value-oriented. economic policies to pursue in safeguarding society against capitalist restoration and achieving economic abundance. Guevara’s speeches to workers are replete with appeals for the masses to step up to this challenge.</em></blockquote><p name="04d4" id="04d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Ironically enough, Che was supported in his approach by the Trotskyist Ernest Mandel, but was opposed by… Charles Bettelheim, who apparently considered Cuba to be far too underdeveloped to be able to ignore the material invectives.</p><blockquote name="c63c" id="c63c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It is universally accepted that under the dictatorship of the proletariat individualized production necessarily implies the maintenance of the “ </em>commodity<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">” and “ </em>money<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> “ categories’</em></blockquote><p name="b6da" id="b6da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">El Commande responded frankly:</p><blockquote name="8e32" id="8e32" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Bettelheim commits two serious errors in analytical method: (a) He mechanically translates the concept of necessary correspondence between relationships of production and development of the productive forces, which is of universal validity, into the ‘microcosm’ of the relationships of production in concrete aspects of a specific country during the period of transition; and thus draws apologetic conclusions tinged with pragmatism, about so-called economic calculus [the AFS].</em></blockquote><p name="c2f8" id="c2f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He would priorize the implementation of a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">New Man</em>, a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Man</em>, able to work for the community as a whole, without looking for his own interest</p><blockquote name="020a" id="020a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In order to develop a new culture, work must acquire a new status. Human beings-as-commodities cease to exist, and a system is installed that establishes a quota for the fulfillment of one’s social duty. The means of production belong to society, and the machine is merely the trench where duty is performed. A person begins to become free from thinking of the annoying fact that one needs to work to satisfy one’s animal needs. Individuals start to see themselves reflected in their work and to understand their full stature as human beings through the object created, through the work accomplished. Work no longer entails surrendering a part of one’s being in the form of labor power sold, which no longer belongs to the individual, but becomes an expression of oneself, a contribution to the common life in which one is reflected, the fulfillment of one’s social duty.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="0a1d" id="0a1d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">We are doing everything possible to give work this new status as a social duty and to link it on the one hand with the development of technology, which will create the conditions for greater freedom, and on the other hand with voluntary work based on the Marxist appreciation that one truly reaches a full human condition when no longer compelled to produce by the physical necessity to sell oneself as a commodity. Of course, there are still coercive aspects to work, even when it is voluntary. We have not transformed all the coercion that surrounds us into conditioned reflexes of a social character and, in many cases, is still produced under the pressures of one’s environment. (Fidel calls this moral compulsion.) There is still a need to undergo a complete spiritual rebirth in one’s attitude toward one’s own work, freed from the direct pressure of the social environment, though linked to it by new habits. That will be communism. The change in consciousness does not take place automatically, just as change in the economy does not take place automatically. The alterations are slow and not rhythmic; there are periods of acceleration, periods that are slower, and even retrogressions.</em></blockquote><p name="2d51" id="2d51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It must be made clear that you see that Che Guevara’s primary objective is the supremacy of state property and planning.

If it is considered as a grouping of producers, owners of their means of production, it is an advance in contrast to capitalism. But in socialism it is a setback, as it places these groupings in opposition to society’s ownership of the other means of production In the USSR the land is social property but not the other means of production that belong to the Kolkhoz, not to mention the small kolkhoznic properties which supply growing quantities of basic foodstuffs and deepen the gap between the society and the kolkhoznics, if not monetarily, then ideologically.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="fdbb" id="fdbb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Kolkhoz peasants are considered as a separate class it is because of the type of property they have; property that should not be considered as a characteristic of socialism but rather of Soviet society (…) Not only have they not exhausted their possibilities, but they can serve for a long time during the development of the forces of production in agriculture (…) a confrontation between social and cooperative ownership will happen, and when they clash (and it could be in the not too distant future) the superstructure will. have the strength to demand more “freedom”, that is to impose conditions; it is worth saying, to return to capitalist forms’.</em></blockquote><p name="2d46" id="2d46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Our international Ernesto will do nothing less than predict the contradiction between individual, decentralized property, attached to its small property, and social property, constituted to improve poor people and operate according to planning.

Then class distinctions and privileges will disappear together with the economical basis upon which they remain. To live on other people’s labor will become a thing of the past. There will be no longer any government or state power, distinct from society itself! Agriculture, mining, manufacturing, in one word, all branches of production, will gradually be organized in the most adequate manner.

It was during this period that the USSR began to adopt a more pragmatic and state-centric approach to global politics, often acting according to its own national interests rather than strictly adhering to revolutionary principles.</p><p name="9401" id="9401" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In practice, this meant that the Soviet leadership began to treat international revolutionary movements as mere pawns in its geopolitical game, frequently sacrificing the ideals of global revolution in favor of consolidating its own power and influence.</p><p name="bbc0" id="bbc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under Stalinism, it would have been inconceivable for the Soviet Union to engage in acts such as the assassination of revolutionary leaders abroad, particularly in countries where socialist movements were struggling to gain traction.</p><p name="30d6" id="30d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The assassination of Hafizullah Amin in Afghanistan is a glaring example of the Soviet Union’s transformation from a revolutionary state into a power concerned more with maintaining its own hegemony than with advancing the cause of international socialism. This stands in stark contrast to the actions of other socialist states, such as Tito’s Yugoslavia, which, despite its differences with the USSR, refrained from engaging in such drastic and overtly imperialist actions. Even the People’s Republic of China, with its own complex foreign policy, did not resort to such measures.</p><p name="c2e6" id="c2e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never the Soviet Union under Stalin’s leadership would resort to such extreme actions dispatching assassins to eliminate a revolutionary leader in a foreign country, followed by military intervention to occupy that country. This shift in policy marks a key moment in the history of Soviet revisionism, one that reflects the broader transformation of the USSR from a revolutionary vanguard into a more conventional and self-interested imperial power.</p><p name="9a97" id="9a97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But despite this bold denunciation of flunkeyism, to quote a phrase from Kim Jong-Il describing this submission to the USSR (“when it rained in Moscow, East Berlin took an umbrella”), Cuba has never managed to go beyond its condition as an exporter? Perhaps because Che’s last plans before his escapades were his attempt to modernize Cuban industry and diversify the different types of specializations.</p><blockquote name="3ba0" id="3ba0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Guevara wanted to increase the exportable base of the country and move towards specialization in the international division of labor within the socialist bloc. In addition, ICIMM (Cuban Institute of Mineral and Metallurgy Research) was to develop technology and investments to expand Antillana de Acero, a steel plant in Havana, to assist a metals plant in Pinar del Río and to instruct the ministry ECs on the development of the iron and steel industry in the west of Cuba. (…)When Guevara left Cuba, the ICIMM was closed down, its functions returned to the pilot plant at Nícaro and the rotating oven transferred for use in a cement factory. Today, the Center for Investigations into the Mineral and Metallurgy Industry (Centro de Investigaciones para la Industria Minería y Metalúrgica) carries out this work in Cuba and once again the development of metallurgy that Guevara promoted is receiving investment. (HF, 183–185).</em></blockquote><p name="9009" id="9009" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Chemistry, metallurgy, geology, steel industry, etc. Everything to transform Cuba into a self-sufficient and independent state, all these plans, thrown in the trash, swept away by the triumphant petty bourgeoisie, represented by Castro. What this tragedy teaches us is that man cannot exist without ideals, and that perhaps the major element remains ideals.</p><p name="f1fc" id="f1fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">G.
