We see three things here: 1) That the constitutional court, and our leadership, either directly works for the rootless cosmopolitan capitalists, or has the same exact mentality (or both). 2) That the great replacement is now reaching the post-communist poor nations. 3) If capitalism persists, our nation will die soon.</p><p name="1b4b" id="1b4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1: Who is the rootless cosmopolitan capitalist? It is the capitalist who cares about one thing; money. Nations and the likes are only engines for him to make money. When nations were fighting one another back in the Napoleonic era, this capitalist made profit, so he had not that much a big issue with nationalism. He just funded all sides, pockets became more fat, and called it a day. But now, that Europe is at relatively at peace, this capitalist fears one thing only: nationalism. A nationalist sees this capitalist for what he is, that is, a money-hungry rootless Jew, a swine making himself fat on the worker’s labor, owning all financial and cultural institutions, spreading degeneration to his people, wishing to convert his people to a Holywood multiracial gay porn fantasy (all this through the electric jew, that he owns). This is the baby nationalist, seeing the result but not the underlying problem, i.e he does not see capitalism as bad. “If only Jews did not control capitalism!”. He is not yet a mature nationalist. A mature nationalist sees also the Judengeist, that is, the mannering of the Jew, his ideas, e.t.c. He sees the unbreaking connection between Judaism and capitalism (as Marx did (1)) and hereby declares: even if all people who are Jews perish, as long as capitalists exist, they will just make a “new Judaism” to drink the blood of the people.</p><p name="69f9" id="69f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The mature nationalist sees therefore Judaism not so much on Jews themselves, but on capitalism, classes, and all these evils that make a nation lose its foundation. All these things that make a nation an abusive household.</p><p name="3241" id="3241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our brethren are still baby nationalists; they see what Rama did with Meloni, and think that any other bourgeoisie government would think differently. Sooner or later, any bourgeoisie government would think the same thing: “how to make profits bigger”. Thus, they think it is an issue of only physical Jews, or Rama or whatever. They do not understand that any capitalist government that blesses private economy (i.e class stratification within the nation) will sooner or later a Jewish mentality to survive competition. Which is, one against all, or as Thacer said it, “there is no society, just individuals”.</p><p name="7c59" id="7c59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is understood therefore? Italy wants immigrants, some of them will go to Albania, our leadership sold our national territory for probably pennies. 35,000 Africans per year in Albania, 350,000 at the very least in 10 years (i.e, about 1/10th of our population). All the lies about them “going back to Italy” are that; lies. If Meloni wanted them to Italy, she could make the facilities in Italy. We, Albanian immigrants in Greece have heard the same things back in early 2010s from Germany. Funny thing is that the center of Athens is full of Bengalis and Sub-Saharan Africans, who breed like rabbits, and who have already formed a country within the country.</p><p name="121e" id="121e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Endpoint; Our government either works for capitalist jews, or has the same mentality; the ending, pretty much the same.</p><p name="bd4c" id="bd4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2: London was 95% English. English are minority now (35%) in their own capital. French people constitute at best, 75% in their own country. 50% of Paris is immigrant. I wont even write about US, or Germany. In Italy, only in 2023 350,000 immigrants entered the country. To make people understand, that is 0.6% of all Italians in Italy. This was done in only one year. If this continues, by 2030, at the very least, there will be 2 million more (on top of the existing 10 million foreigners) in Italy, making up for at least 9 million, i.e 16% of all Italy. Combine this with low birthrates (we can all thank feminism and emasculation) and in 50 years, all European nations will be big Londons.</p><p name="fb8b" id="fb8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shqipe, if you think you will be the only one abandoning your nation for Greece, Switzerland and god knows where, you are fooled. Eddie will just import cheap labor, and marry your sister to Mutumbu. All this with the blessing of non-binary daddy/mother USA.</p><p name="32a0" id="32a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3: All these things, as explained, are the result of capitalist development. Thanks to Capitalism, not only Albania but Europe itself will vanish. Capitalism means no nation, no race, no family, and no nation, no race, no family means no meaning to live.</p><p name="d4bc" id="d4bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How you feel lale?
