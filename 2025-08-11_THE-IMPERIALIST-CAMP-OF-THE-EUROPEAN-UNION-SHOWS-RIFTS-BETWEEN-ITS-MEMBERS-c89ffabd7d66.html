There are also some developments which could point in both directions; either reactionary or progressive.</p><p name="464e" id="464e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Good developments could be the facts that the bloody war in Nagorno-Karabakh stopped, that the progressive forces of Mali revolted against the corrupt and murderous comprador bourgeoisie, the fact America started pulling out of Afghanistan, Somalia and other western neo-colonies, that the progressive governments of Belarus, Venezuela, Bolivia, are still standing despite fierce the horrible reaction imposed against them, the reactionaries at Hong Kong are being put in their place, and other events which were positive for the imperialized nations of the world.</p><p name="5f36" id="5f36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, good events are followed by bad events too. The fascists who work for the European Union won the elections in Moldova, war erupted in Ethiopia, and the progressive forces of the world are receiving blowbacks here and there.</p><p name="ba5f" id="ba5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here we will analyse the event which we called uncertain on its level of progressiveness. This event is the recent intra-cosmopolitan bourgeoisie skirmish. The higher ops of this alliance are mad at their allies and compradors for barking at them. The EU refused to give the billions which were agreed months ago on the basis of recovery from COVID on countries which ‘dont abide by the rule of law’. This basically means that if per EU you dont abide by its rules, you arent getting a penny. So, EU virtue signalled Hungary and Poland (while ignoring France which is brutally suppressing the protests since more than a year) on their implementation of ‘Rule of Law’. The aim of EU is to ‘check’ these compradors from rising their head too much. A smart king gives concessions to his vassals, but also cuts their air once they seem to become too big to control. The internal contradictions of EU are becoming evident. What is becoming more evident is the fact that the comprador regimes of EU wont be compradors forever; either bigger part of the pie flows to them too, or they are going for permanent vacation to Moscow, with the next stop being Beijing!</p><p name="6d6e" id="6d6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is very interesting are the speeches given by the leaders of the trio (Hungary, Slovenia, Poland) which barked against EU. Lets start with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki</p><p name="aa16" id="aa16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An EU in which there is a European oligarchy that punishes the weakest (of the member states) is not the EU we have entered and it is not the EU that has a future. We say ‘yes’ to the European Union, but ‘no’ to being punished like children. ‘No’ to mechanisms which mean that Poland and other countries are treated unfairly. It is a question of sovereignty.</p><p name="90f0" id="90f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today you think this instrument is directed against us, against Hungary, maybe against Slovenia, maybe against some other country in central Europe. In a few years, in two or three years, it could be directed against someone else.</p><p name="86b3" id="86b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a turning point in the history of the EU. Making decisions based on arbitrary provisions in the regulations can lead to its collapse. [1]</p><p name="dc91" id="dc91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is Morawiecki telling EU here? Either give us more parts of the pie unconditionally, or we are flying like birds to other arms.</p><p name="5282" id="5282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, Poland right now is not an imperialized nation.</p><p name="45f0" id="45f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is deeply integraded within the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie camp, the population there receives large sums from the imperialist plunder pie, and thus the population there is largely parasitic and thus remains out of radical politics and plays well with their bourgeoisie the ‘cooperation’ game. Poland is not in the higher ops of this camp, but is not in the bottom either. They are clearly in somewhere between the middle, with it being in the middle between Hungary and Slovenia – with Slovenia being on the top of these three – and there is room for radical politics to being played. A small, but significant room for a communist movement to organize itself.</p><p name="f64a" id="f64a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the Labour aristocrats which form a large part of the working class population there can’t stay stagnant forever. They need more pie to consume. For the bourgeoisie that rules Poland this is a death card. They cant do anything to bring a larger part of the pie to share, so either they start cutting profits (But who of them will do this sacrifice and give the competitors an advantage?), find other allies or have the communists slowly but steadily becoming a force. The protests in Poland had no radical elements generally, but the fierceness which the bourgeoisie showed to these liberal protests, means they are afraid of radicalism very much. Since the Polish state is one of the main campaigners of the ‘two extremes theory’, which essentially means they are very afraid of Stalinism to the point of making it illegal, this anxiety of them to find more to feed the parasites is because they know that if the parasites stop receiving the pie, they will turn to radicalism instead. And radicalism can very possible mean that some Polish bourgeoisie heads will fly off like in the 40s.</p><p name="9f87" id="9f87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What the Polish ruling bourgeoisie are saying is that they can’t go backwards, but only forward. They are saying to the EU that instead of blocking them the part of the pie they ‘deserve’, they should start ‘treat’ in a fair manner’the parasites residing in Poland or else ‘EU may collapse’.</p><p name="d63d" id="d63d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since the EU cant collapse by magic, they are threatening the EU bourgeoisie with secession. That they don’t threaten it directly means that the situation is not so bad for the Polish compradors to break away, but they leave the possibility open for this to be the case in some years.</p><p name="b4d4" id="b4d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Orban of Hungary said is similar, but he also includes immigration. Now, the Hungarian bourgeoisie would very much love the immigrants to come, but they know that the mechanisms of capitalism would then force the wage down and the labour aristocracy would lose part of the pie to the newcomers from the imperialized nations. This would create an angry labour aristocracy, and would jeopardise the unity of the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie comprador and the labour aristocracy, and if this unity breaks then the bourgeoisie are in a potential high level danger. Orban representing this fear of the Hungarian bourgeoisie says to the higher ops of the EU that more immigration would jeopardise the unity with the Labour aristocracy in Hungary, and this is a step that the Hungarian bourgeoisie dont want to go, to the point of vetoing the decision of their masters.</p><p name="8b33" id="8b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now he go to Slovenia, the more parasitic in quantity nation of these three. The prime minister Janza backed Hungary and Poland[2] and thus the Slovenian</p><p name="190f" id="190f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">bourgeoisie barked too to the EU higher ops. Now the question comes; is this small skirmish a progressive or reactionary event?</p><p name="3b34" id="3b34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any committed anti-Imperialist (which all real Communists are) would tell you that this skirmish is indeed a progressive event. It shows that even the lackeys of EU are willing to spread anti EU sentiments to the population for their own benefits of course, but still, negative sentiment, which means a more fractured EU.</p><p name="bd55" id="bd55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more fractured the EU, the more fractured the imperialist Cosmopolitan bourgeoisie camp, and thus the better for all the progressive anti imperialist and oppressed nations of the world! Of course, the Hungarian (like the Polish and the Slovenians) bourgeoisie will not really break EU just by this relatively mild incident. But this skirmish may bring the populations of these countries to a more anti-EU direction. The anti-imperialists living in these countries should not condemn the bourgeoisie for criticizing the EU.</p><p name="e860" id="e860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If they do so without pushing further than the bourgeoisie and demand secession from EU and try to advance the communist movement by taking advantage of anti EU sentiment, they play the game the imperialists want them to play.</p><p name="7538" id="7538" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Criticizing the bourgeoisie who themselves criticize the chiefs of the imperialist of the world, the higher ops of the EU, because this breaks the ‘unity of the EU’ or because it hinders their population from taking their share of the imperialist plunder pie, means actually taking the side of imperialism. It means being more right wing than the comprador bourgeoise themselves. It means effectively betraying the world anti-imperialist movement, betraying the oppressed of the world!</p><p name="cf13" id="cf13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is the epitome of Labour aristocratic parasitic politics.</p><p name="5917" id="5917" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reaction to this skirmish show a lot of things. From Romania taking the side of EU[3] hoping to be a good puppy and receive the part of the pie, which they will probably never receive anyway, to the reaction of the main ‘leftist’ party in Slovenia, Levica. Bellow we give the declaration of Levica on the issue.</p><p name="4fab" id="4fab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Janez Janša supported the governments of Poland and Hungary, which threaten to veto the European Recovery and Resilience Fund and the new multiannual financial plan if the EU makes the payment of these funds conditional on respect for the rule of law and separation of powers. With this, Janša stepped against the interests of Slovenia, which desperately needs European help in the crisis, as well as the entire EU. In order to return the services to Orban, who is financing the media network in Slovenia, Janša is obviously ready to risk access to 10 billion European money, which he boasted of having «won» in the summer. At the same time, he again spat on Slovenia’s reputation in the world, as he also wrote in the letter that the elections held in 2014 were “stolen” in Slovenia. The fact that Janša is now forming a coalition with the party that accuses him of stealing the elections six years ago – SMC, shows that this is again a provocation that he does not care about Slovenia’s reputation.[4]</p><p name="6846" id="6846" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this short piece, Levica managed to betray everything about itself making obvious its allegiance to the Slovenian labour aristocracy, and by extension the European</p><p name="11ed" id="11ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Labour aristocracy and Imperialism in general.</p><p name="2d63" id="2d63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are good comrades in Levica, communists, antiimperialists, but this should not cloud our criticisms of the party. The party by this declaration effectively gives its allegiance to the labour aristocracy and the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie at the helm of the EU.</p><p name="da57" id="da57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is Levica saying? That the population ‘needs’ the 10 billion. From where will the 10 billion be made from?</p><p name="c99f" id="c99f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the backs of the oppressed nations working for five euros per day to feed the Slovenian wage which is ten times bigger. Because how can Levica claim to be anti-EU when they plead for stolen money? Socialism only for Slovenia we guess!</p><p name="a452" id="a452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some may say that Levica should have criticized the representative of the Slovenian bourgeoisie, Jansa. Of course, this is absolutely correct. But there are criticisms and criticisms. There is the right wing criticisms, the reactionary, pro-imperialist criticism which is about Jansa barking against the imperialist cosmopolitans, about the act itself, and there is the left wing, the revolutionary, the anti-imperialist criticism, which criticizes Jansa for being too moderate against EU.</p><p name="67d9" id="67d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Levica chose the first kind of criticism, and thus they show where their allegiance stands.</p><p name="4983" id="4983" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shame to the party, even if good people may be in their ranks.</p><p name="dc8a" id="dc8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But these events and these statements will remain in history for the future generations to study. When the Bourgeoisie are more ‘left’ than the ‘left’ itself, we have a serious problem.</p><p name="94ab" id="94ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F. U.
