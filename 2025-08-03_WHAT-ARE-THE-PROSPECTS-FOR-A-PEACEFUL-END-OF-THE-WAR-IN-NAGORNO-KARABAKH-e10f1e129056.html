The day during the meeting between Lavrov and the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Ilhan Alieyev announced that Azerbaijan captured Hadrut settlement, Chayli, Yukhari Guzlak, Gorazilli, Qishlag, Garajali, Efendilar, Suleymanli, and Sur villages. In short, a huge victory for Azerbaijan, which would further encircle Fuzuli and put pressure to Armenia.</p><p name="53de" id="53de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What also happened was Russia saying that Artsakh is not part of the defence pact of CSTO,[2] in short, directly telling to the world after Iran that Artsakh does not belong to Armenia, essentially following the «international law».</p><p name="a2e9" id="a2e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, we have that announcement of Aliyev, which means that a ceasefire for Azerbaijan would be a loss, considering that they are winning. We also have statements from Pashinyan previously declaring that Artzakh is Armenian and that his country wont give up the struggle for Artsakh.</p><p name="147e" id="147e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this means? It means that neither side is interested to give land to one another. What this means? It means that a peaceful solution would mean that one of these two countries would give up land that both consider theirs, an act that both nation’s citizens, due to their own governments anti-proletarian bourgeoisie nationalist indoctrination and propaganda would consider a treason and un-acceptable and thus it would mean the end of the government doing so, and in short it would mean that such an act is practically impossible.</p><p name="78b0" id="78b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, there is no peaceful solution as far as the states of Armenia and Azerbaijan remain as they are: Bourgeoisie states, ruled by the economic laws of capitalism which makes the different bourgeoisie classes of both nations impossible to be one, which makes them objects of competition, which prohibits them to follow nothing else than profit and interest.</p><p name="b3c8" id="b3c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since artsakh is an object of mutual competition, profit and interest for these two divided bourgeoisie classes, or «corporations» so to say, one should eat the other, and each other considers the other a thorn in its foot.</p><p name="3fdc" id="3fdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here we have something else to consider too.</p><p name="bdd9" id="bdd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lets suppose that a peaceful solution for now is sealed. A ceasefire. A ceasefire was declared 25 years ago. And the war is raging again. This proves that is impossible to stop an all out war while also staying dominated by the logic of capitalism. Only a socialist revolution would be an act which would bring peaceful solution to the table in reality. Considering that both nation’s communist parties have put revolution out of the table for now, the workers of Azerbaijan and Armenia will be forced to die or build a new party or push their parties to revolution. Seeing that there was not even large demonstration for peace from both countries, there is no possibility to speak of revolution as long as 2020 lasts, and if there is no revolution there can’t be peace.</p><p name="ccfa" id="ccfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any talk of peace is just dust in the eyes of the tired workers of both countries.</p><p name="8c9a" id="8c9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As proved by reality, the ceasefire did not last more than a hour, and the war is continuing as normal.</p><p name="5229" id="5229" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The communists of Armenia and Azerbaijan should really gather their revolutionary spirit and act accordingly. Lets not forget that it was during the German-French war that the proletariat of Paris did its revolution and declared international solidarity between the workers of the two nations. If the communist parties of both countries miss this change, they will be to blame for the total slaughter of their proletarians.</p><p name="cfb0" id="cfb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The people who are advocating for this nation to nation war, in all mediums, be it internet, the local gatherings, in their friends e.t.c are not the ones who die for the pocket of Aliyev and Pashinyan. Let them go pick a gun and die by an airstrike, without even seeing their death coming!</p><p name="2f07" id="2f07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The communist and thus, the right, moral, and proven solution, is revolution, end to capitalist wars, and worker internationalism against the cosmopolitanism of the capitalists who steer smaller nations to war for their own profit and the profit of their compradors there.</p><p name="bae0" id="bae0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We really hope, that what this article writes will be proven a lie and incorrect, and that a peaceful solution can be achieved between the two nations immediately, but following simple facts and logic, it is unlikely.</p><figure name="75cb" id="75cb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VesIdag5x_HZvjD3WcdFqA@2x.jpeg" data-width="382" data-height="382" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VesIdag5x_HZvjD3WcdFqA@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="a232" id="a232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">F.
