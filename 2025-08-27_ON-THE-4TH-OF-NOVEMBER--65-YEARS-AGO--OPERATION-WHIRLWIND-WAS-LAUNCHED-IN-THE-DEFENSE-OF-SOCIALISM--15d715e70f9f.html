While decried after the felling of socialism as uncomfortable, badly insulated where you can hear a neighbour from half a building away, it was an answer to a burning lack of homes, and to the cramped conditions and unsanitary shanties people lived in before. It was not uncommon to share a single multiple-room flat that was once owned by a single family with 8–10 more people, as large apartments were carved up and portioned out to put roofs above people’s heads.</p><p name="3fb0" id="3fb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These panel houses were built together as the «housing colonies» of Óbuda (Old Buda), Újpalota, Gazdagrét, Kelenföld, Ferencváros (József Attila lakótelep) in the capital, but also around larger cities in the countryside.</p><p name="ed71" id="ed71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For all their drawbacks, they provided millions with warm water, heated homes and space for the first time of their life.</p><p name="2ddd" id="2ddd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Industry-wise, hungarian made Ikarus buses were famous and ran from the arctic to the deserts in the socialist bloc (from Havanna to Kamchatka), and they even run today in the DPRK (converted as trolley buses).</p><p name="64b6" id="64b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is also worth noting that in contemporary capitalist hungary, despite the «soaring economy» that was proclaimed both in the mid-2000s by the liberal government and nowadays by the Orbán-led conservative one, a significant portion of the vehicle park is still the socialist-made Ikarus vehicles, each well over 32 year old! Additionally, Hungary made it’s own trams, train cars, locomotives, and so on.</p><h3 name="bad6" id="bad6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The «Failures» of Socialism</h3><p name="1026" id="1026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Socialist Hungary’s failing was at allowing liberal and conservative infiltration of the party, which crippled it at a critical moment in 1989, allowing western-funded, western-trained opposition to take leadership of the country.</p><p name="477c" id="477c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nowadays The Ganz factory that supplied us with trams and trains has been turned into a park, alongside the ministry of industry building which we no longer need since our industry is just foreign companies using us for cheap labour. There is a housing crisis, we are reduced to trying to maintain the existing socialist-era panel housing. We are importing food, while exporting raw materials (grain). Of our 13 sugar factories we managed to retain one!</p><p name="12bd" id="12bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nowadays if we want trams, we buy them used (!!!) from some western country for astronomical prices, and only run them in the most «representative» places, while the side-routes are still handled by our aging Ganz and Tatra park.</p><p name="1953" id="1953" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Same for trains. Some «everyday» lines around Budapest are replaced with imported locomotives and cars. For the rest, the overwhelming majority, its old cars where the shit literally goes straight to the rails (and it’s forbidden to use the toilet in towns). Literally the same old shit.</p><p name="6d85" id="6d85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps the most illustrative of it all is the plan to build a vaccine factory. It was decided back in 2018, and they still couldn’t start the project until well into the secondthird wave of Covid.</p><p name="39c3" id="39c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is more to say, but it is needless at this point to further emphasize how much Hungary lost with the loss of socialism. It was without doubt the golden age of our people.</p><p name="c0c2" id="c0c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eternal glory and thanks for the defenders of socialism!</p><p name="1db4" id="1db4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Imre Monokli, November 4 2021</p></div></div></section>
