I am not writing this to explain fundamental theory or even ridicule and/or criticize western “””leftists””” as I often do, but this is simply an observation that everyone serious about Marxism or scientific socialism has made shortly after developing an interest.</p><p name="1473" id="1473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In countries within the imperial core, the utterly idiotic and evidently liberal practice of pointing out the most shallow correlations possible and then expanding greatly upon these pretenses is widespread. To them, socialism is some blindly altruistic kind of idealism with the goal of helping “the poor”. Though scientific socialism has proven time and again that its practice does lift whole nations out of poverty and distribute wealth far more evenly through the abolition of private property, this misconception is still just that.</p><p name="f965" id="f965" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Communism does not represent altruism or some idealistic kindness. It represents pragmatism and fairness with the central principle of the productive forces being entitled to consume in proportion to how much they produce. We do not inherently represent those in poverty nor relative poverty (ie. poorer labor aristocrats in the imperial core), we represent the proletariat who are greatly undercompensated despite being the foundation of the economy and the reason for any wealth in the first place. The naive and misguided have often conflated poverty with revolutionary potential.</p><p name="f259" id="f259" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a historical example, I will direct you to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Anarchism or Socialism</em> [1].</p><blockquote name="60ec" id="60ec" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">For example. In the eighties of the last century a great controversy flared up among the Russian revolutionary intelligentsia. The Narodniks asserted that the main force that could undertake the task of “emancipating Russia” was the petty bourgeoisie, rural and urban. Why? the Marxists asked them. Because, answered the Narodniks, the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie now constitute the majority and, moreover, they are poor, they live in poverty.</blockquote><blockquote name="4cf4" id="4cf4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">To this the Marxists replied: It is true that the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie now constitute the majority and are really poor, but is that the point? The petty bourgeoisie has long constituted the majority, but up to now it has displayed no initiative in the struggle for “freedom” without the assistance of the proletariat. Why? Because the petty bourgeoisie as a class is not growing; on the contrary, it is disintegrating day by day and breaking up into bourgeois and proletarians. On the other hand, nor is poverty of decisive importance here, of course: “tramps” are poorer than the petty bourgeoisie, but nobody will say that they can undertake the task of “emancipating Russia”. As you see, the point is not which class today constitutes the majority, or which class is poorer, but which class is gaining strength and which is decaying.</blockquote><p name="c69b" id="c69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">With that said, it is fair, albeit grossly oversimplified to assert that our cause does represent the exploited and the underprivileged with all revolutionary potential resting in these people’s hands. However, if one is to say this about communism, I would implore them to qualify that these underprivileged, exploited masses we uphold and represent, are in fact productive forces who are not compensated in proportion to the work they do.</p><p name="c084" id="c084" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alas, the reason I am writing any of this at all is because that essential addendum is omitted by the charlatans claiming themselves to be Marxist in the west. There is already a great deal of mental gymnastics that these people must perform. It is essential in convincing oneself that they are truly anti-imperialist or socialist when looking to elevate the workforce of a western country, knowing full well that they are inadvertently representing the profiteers of imperialism who are already overcompensated, relative poverty and day-to-day struggles notwithstanding.</p><p name="98dc" id="98dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without mincing words, to these people, to possess revolutionary potential, one simply needs to have contempt for the status quo. They will try to appeal to people who would normally vote for social fascists with the end-goal of “taxing the rich” and simply spreading the plunder of imperialism more evenly among the “middle class”, while also claiming to be “anti-capitalist”. To them, someone like this has revolutionary potential insofar as they can be “radicalized” due to their contempt for capitalism. The reality is that these parasitic unproductives do not truly oppose capitalism or the fact that their standard of living is granted through the literal blood, sweat and tears of the proletariat. They hate that there isn’t even more finance imperialism to afford them their right to be lazy.</p><p name="42d6" id="42d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This should put into perspective that the target demographic of the western leftist possesses no revolutionary potential whatsoever. Their interests are intrinsically tied to the left flank of imperialism which necessitates that they will always uphold the fascist regimes of the imperialist bloc. Beyond all that, there is the greater question of what revolutionary potential truly entails.</p><p name="334c" id="334c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though the groups I ridicule regularly do profit from imperialism and do not truly hate capitalism, that is neither here nor there. There are the lumpenproletariat, who legitimately lack consumption power and have the capacity to at least aspire to the destruction of reactionary regimes. In a western leftist’s thought process they will believe that they should encourage a collaboration between the labor aristocracy they attempt to represent and the lumpenproletariat on the grounds that they both are relatively poor for people living in the west and may have reason to desire change.</p><p name="933f" id="933f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Communist Manifesto</em> [2], Marx described the lumpenproletariat as:</p><blockquote name="71d4" id="71d4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">…the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.</blockquote><p name="2dfc" id="2dfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Though one of these groups is inherently reactionary with no proletarian character whatsoever and the other is the lumpenproletariat, it does not make the endeavors of the western leftist any less absurd. To put this as bluntly as I possibly can, the contempt any class has for capitalism means little to nothing if they do not produce.</p><p name="e113" id="e113" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The lumpenproletariat are commonly recognized as those within the proletariat without any revolutionary potential with examples being various hustlers, drug dealers, prostitutes, thieves, etc.. It is not common for people to analyze exactly how and why this class is incapable of revolution. This is likely why even the few respectable comrades in the west may be confused and claim that they can be molded into revolutionaries.</p><p name="661b" id="661b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will grant anyone who believes this that these people are capable of possibly revolutionary thought, but little beyond that. They simply do not have access to the means of production. The fact that anybody believes that the lumpenproletariat can be a revolutionary class strongly indicates that they do not understand why the proletariat has such potential for revolution. This has been acknowledged as a grievous error by Great Lenin [3] himself.</p><blockquote name="b112" id="b112" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Rosa acted and felt as a communist when in an article she championed the cause of the prostitutes who were imprisoned for any transgression of police regulations in carrying on their dreary trade. They are, unfortunately, doubly sacrificed by bourgeois society. First, by its accursed property system, and, secondly, by its accursed moral hypocrisy. That is obvious. Only he who is brutal or short-sighted can forget it. But still, that is not at all the same thing as considering prostitutes — how shall I put it? — to be a special revolutionary militant section, as organising them and publishing a factory paper for them. Aren’t there really any other working women in Germany to organise, for whom a paper can be issued, who must be drawn into your struggles? The other is only a diseased excrescence. It reminds me of the literary fashion of painting every prostitute as a sweet Madonna. The origin of that was healthy, too: social sympathy, rebellion against the virtuous hypocrisy of the respectable bourgeois. But the healthy part became corrupted and degenerate.</blockquote><p name="62b9" id="62b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Simply put, the proletariat are the sole class that operates the means of production meaning that nothing gets produced and there is no economy without them. I implore the reader to think of what happens if factory workers go on strike. Not only is nothing going to be produced for the duration, they cannot be replaced as no one else would know how to operate the equipment. They possess revolutionary potential because damn near the entire economy ceases to exist without them.</p><p name="c2e6" id="c2e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This cannot be said of the lumpenproletariat. Absolutely nothing of value is lost in the event that they stop working, life goes on as usual and in the event that they ever were given access to the means of production, it would go to waste. Loathe as the “””leftists””” living off the fat of imperialism are to admit, revolutionary potential is not in the hands of people who are merely malcontents. To consider a class as having revolutionary potential, they must be of immense consequence to the economy as a whole which necessitates knowledge of and access to the means of production. In the event that they do not, they will neither be able to leverage the bourgeoisie prior to revolution nor will they be able to consolidate and maintain power in the aftermath.</p><p name="dad3" id="dad3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I must address the main topic. In the wake of neoliberalism, this counter-revolutionary class has been used to undermine the just cause of proletarians and anti-imperialists the world over. It has become a reliable strategy for the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie to elevate the lumpenproletariat which results in all legitimate working class causes being defanged and debased in the eyes of the general public. Their business and their mere involvement in our cause is enough to cause us to hemorrhage popular support due to the masses seeing our cause as hyperliberal and degenerate.</p><p name="f678" id="f678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The symptoms of this are evident to anybody who follows the corny, surreal and borderline incomprehensible political discourse, ever-present in the imperial core. Even if one chooses not to, they will be exposed to the flaccid, superficial talking points of radical liberals regarding this topic if they simply follow any kind of entertainment coming from the west. It is common knowledge that an artist will often use their work as a mechanism to convey some kind of point or deeper message. Unfortunately, given that these types come from states with the most reactionary bases, they will only advocate for fascism and further imperialistic parasitism, no matter what mental gymnastics and emotional manipulation is employed in their work.</p><p name="1cd5" id="1cd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Loathe as I am in bringing up Hollywood and entertainment in my writing, albeit briefly, it is actually pertinent to the recent “bleeding heart” sentiment that westerners feel towards the lumpenproletariat. There is little that one can do to make the average person feel sympathy for drug pushers, pimps and thieves while still making cogent, objective points, so this is where emotions come into play. Although it would be unsurprising that one may come across a liberal writing a polemic about the “hard life” of hustlers while advocating the legalization of drugs, prostituion and otherwise promoting moral nihilism, it is more likely that the polemic was delivered in an artistic fashion, especially if the work is in relation to the drug trade.</p><p name="fc87" id="fc87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The long and short of any depiction of the drug trade that’s rendered by a liberal is that those involved in the trade are victims of circumstance and seldom involved due to greed or any ulterior motive (at least initially). In their illustrations of the outside world, these “bleeding heart” social fascists will try to convince everyone that the drug trade is comprised of individuals living in such poverty and with so little opportunity to escape it, that they have no options, but to sell drugs or get involved in some other hustle in order to sustain themselves. They will legitimately internalize this idea that those in relatively impoverished areas would have so little consumption power, regardless of other opportunities that they would have no choice but to become involved in illicit business. Depending on how ham-fisted they are with the point, they may show one’s participation in the trade as possibly heroic and will naturally push to integrate both the business(es) and the hustlers into the white market economy.</p><p name="9f5f" id="9f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As with all other verbal diarrhea spewed by western chauvinists, their entire point is idealistic, much of their points are pulled out of thin air and they expect people to believe the most counter-intuitive, thinly veiled consumerist drivel possible. I will focus on the manufactured victimhood of those “coerced” into being involved in the drug trade, but for future reference, apply what I am about to explain to any given instance where somebody tries to make you feel the pain of the lumpenproletariat in the soul.</p><p name="bbf0" id="bbf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As previously mentioned, the gullible and/or cynical choose to push the notion that the choice regarding this kind of business is practically nonexistent and is literally a matter of life and death as it concerns certain people. In the interest of not elaborating this disinformation any further, I will come out and say that these people have little to no understanding of how the trades of the lumpenproletariat actually function. For one, it is not nearly as lucrative as they would like you to believe.</p><p name="c2d8" id="c2d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth of the matter is that the majority of drug dealers, the “corner boys” who actually do struggle and who are meant to be the object of your sympathy, are not even financially secure after getting involved. The nature of the drug trade in particular means that there will be a great disparity in income between different ranks in the hierarchy. The ones who actually make money would be the wholesaler (otherwise known as the connect), the distributor and then their primeras. In such a business, you would have a few people at higher ranks making a great deal of money, whereas the street-level dealers who the primeras would sell to are making around $2500 a year. That’s approximately $7 a day with less than $1 being made in an hour.</p><p name="decf" id="decf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that the notion of pedders lacking economic opportunity is bunk. No one should need to explain that they would make much more money even if they decided to do service work. They do not begin hustling out of the need for sustenance. The truth is that they aspire to become bourgeois and to possess great consumption power. Simply put, this does not come to pass unless they assume the role of their superiors. More often than not, this would entail killing them after making an arrangement with the higher-ups in the network. There is no other way. No one gets involved in these hustles because they lack opportunity. They get involved, bide their time, gain access to higher-ups, kill their superiors and then profit greatly while repeating the cycle as many times as they possibly can.</p><p name="8f9a" id="8f9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It should be fairly intuitive that to undermine the potential of any truly revolutionary movement, all a counter-revolutionary force would truly need to achieve is the gradual erosion of all proletarian character. The truly obvious symptoms have been observed even by those who are merely superficially opposed to capitalism. For one, the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie will partake in campaigns to liquidate the proletariat into the labor aristocracy. That is a part of nature taking its course in the aftermath of neoliberalism. Once a greater portion of the global south is imperialized, there is less need for proletarian labor and they can focus on elevating the “middle class”. The other angle, which I am surprised no one takes seriously is that they merely infiltrate the legitimate anti-imperialist movements using the lumpenproletariat.</p><p name="0cda" id="0cda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To make my point, I will bring up the ways in which the CIA employed the hippies as useful idiots in defanging and discrediting the anti-war movement in the US following WWII. Though this is no longer the case due to Americans benefiting from parasitism en-masse, there were legitimately groups that possessed revolutionary potential back then. These would be the working class and the students who prior to hippification would have been inclined to support them. I am certain that the crimes of the McCarthyist fascists are common knowledge so I will only mention the infiltration of the CPUSA and the illegal spying on communists in passing.</p><p name="d5ac" id="d5ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wish to focus on the lesser known tactics employed by the US regime. The previously mentioned workers and radically inclined intelligentsia (mostly students) were disciplined, organized adherents of Marxism-Leninism who legitimately posed a threat to the yankee fascists. In the immediate aftermath of WWII, folk singers would tour the country updating well-known songs to advocate the liberation of the worker. The CIA employed the use of psychedelic drugs, in particular, LSD to induce chaos and effectively destroy the movement outright.</p><p name="0e6c" id="0e6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, the notoriety of meaningful, substantial art for the benefit of the proletariat was undermined by the emergence of the hedonistic, individualistic genre known as rock ‘n roll. Regarding LSD, the US government had purchased the entire world’s supply of LSD for $240,000 and effectively established a monopoly. They then targeted students specifically flooding college campuses with the drug. This means that students who otherwise would be inclined to organize with unions and stand in solidarity with the working class were converted into hedonistic, degenerate hippies.</p><p name="3650" id="3650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the reader has any doubts, a professor named Timothy Leary became notorious for passing out LSD to his students, both graduate and undergraduate before getting fired and going on to write books and tour the US advocating for the youth to experiment with drugs. He even went as far as to admit that this fake cultural movement was initiated by the CIA and admitted to being in favor of the CIA’s actions. On top of all this, LSD is also attached to the progenitors of rock ‘n roll who effectively ended any cultural activity in the US that would have benefitted the workers. In stark contrast to the collectivist, proletarian nature of the folk singers, the popular artists were all hedonistic, individualistic, morally nihilistic bourgeois who defaulted to a position of support for the status quo.</p><p name="654d" id="654d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though this is a gross oversimplification, the anti-war, pro-union elements actually posed a legitimate threat to the US regime and the CIA had to work meticulously to divide and conquer its opposition. The proletariat who were the basis of the movement were gradually integrated into the labor aristocracy, the intelligentsia (radical students) who otherwise would have supported them were drugged into complacency and the popular support that could have been garnered by the earlier cultural activity was replaced by an art form that proudly exhibited the characteristics of the lumpenproletariat.</p><p name="8b3c" id="8b3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If ever the intelligentsia had the capacity to assist the workers, it was gone the moment they forsook material reality, chose drugs and became complacent. Without mincing words, the workers were bought off or liquidated and the intelligentsia became hippies. If one knows what a hippie is, they know that they are labor aristocrat intelligentsia who are practically lumpenproletariat by choice. The end result of these maneuvers was the destruction of any pro-worker, anti imperialist movement in the US.</p><p name="63db" id="63db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The conditions for serious popular support were present, but the focus went from the workers to some abstract concept of “the poor” (specifically the lumpenproletariat who physically embodied the spirit of “sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll), the sympathetic intelligentsia were replaced by idiot hippies and no sane person would ever rally behind such degeneracy.</p><p name="1c3a" id="1c3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The lumpenproletariat, this scum of the decaying elements of all classes, which establishes headquarters in all the big cities, is the worst of all possible allies. It is an absolutely venal, an absolutely brazen crew. If the French workers, in the course of the Revolution, inscribed on the houses: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mort aux voleurs!</em> (Death to the thieves!) and even shot down many, they did it, not out of enthusiasm for property, but because they rightly considered it necessary to hold that band at arm’s length. Every leader of the workers who utilises these gutter-proletarians as guards or supports, proves himself by this action alone a traitor to the movement. [4]</p><p name="86fb" id="86fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If anyone is inclined to glance over the entirety of what I’ve written up to this point, so be it. However, I must insist that you pay heed to my parting thoughts. It is elementary to any serious Marxist that in order for the bourgeoisie to exist, it necessitates the exploitation of the proletariat and in today’s world, this dynamic does not simply apply to oppressed and oppressor classes. It applies to oppressed and oppressor nations. A country in the imperial core, which conducts almost all of its industrial production automatically and is filled to the brim with unproductive, overcompensated labor aristocrats cannot continue to exist without oppressing the proletariat of a foreign nation.</p><p name="f4bb" id="f4bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the expansion of the “middle class” within the imperial core, the consequence has been and always will be more imperialist intervention in the global south. This is what one should expect when they see the rise of unproductive labor and entire “industries” backing it up. This does relate to the lumpenproletariat as they have historically been used by the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie to promote the complete and utter rot of working class movements. The point to remember is that the hedonism of the hippie goes hand in hand with the degenerate consumerism that is common among all neoliberal forces.</p><p name="3ffb" id="3ffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are all well aware of the fact that the “work” and “industries” of the lumpenproletariat do not account for production in any way, shape or form. These lines of “work” are upheld by commodification and this need to coerce the average person into being a “good consumer”. In the event that the masses bought into the “bleeding heart” drivel of the left flank of imperialism, it will give rise to industries that have no right to exist in the first place seeing as they don’t produce anything and line the imperialists’ pockets beautifully. The cost, however, will be shouldered by the proletariat of oppressed nations.</p><p name="b61b" id="b61b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is quite simple. The more resources go into unproductive business, the greater the exploitation of those opposed to NATO hegemony. Furthermore and finally, the commodification of labor is the first thing that any serious communist would want to prohibit. It is contrary to everything we stand for to believe that communists would allow there to be commodification of any kind after the seizure of the means of production. In the case of the lumpenproletariat, they often literally sell themselves (prostitution) and otherwise do not produce anything.</p><p name="69b5" id="69b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As communists, we would prohibit a worker from being exploited, whether they were accepting of this or not. In addition, we would not afford any quarter to historically counter-revolutionary classes like the lumpenproletariat. It is not just the fact that they have always been incapable of revolution. It has now gotten to the point where their interests ultimately serve imperialism.</p><p name="ab94" id="ab94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aarif Firaas, 5/11/2021</p><p name="5f9d" id="5f9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">REFERENCES:</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="6760" id="6760" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1906/12/x01.htm" data-href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1906/12/x01.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1906/12/x01.htm</a></li><li name="b938" id="b938" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm%23007" data-href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm%23007" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007</a></li><li name="f946" id="f946" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm" data-href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm</a></li><li name="1dd8" id="1dd8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing"><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/peasant-war-germany.pdf" data-href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/peasant-war-germany.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/peasant-war-germany.pdf</a></li></ol></div></div></section>
