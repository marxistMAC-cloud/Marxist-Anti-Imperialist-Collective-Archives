<section name="f418" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="8abf" id="8abf" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">The nuclear rearmament of UK</h3><p name="a311" id="a311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">These last few months, there has been plenty of talk about a potential all out war, especially with regards to the situation in Ukraine. In this day and age, this would certainly mean a nuclear war. Countries that once possessed large amounts of nuclear warheads have greatly reduced their stockpiles since the end of the Cold War. Nuclear stockpiles have been decreasing since the late 80s, but that is changing. I will go over the latest information about all nuclear and potentially nuclear powers so as to get a clearer picture of the upcoming Nuclear Rearmament.</p><p name="3108" id="3108" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first country in the NATO camp to increase its nuclear stockpile in decades has done so already and the process is still ongoing. The country in question is the United Kingdom. There was no outrage from the “international community” and basically no media coverage. The information was buried on the 76th page of the government’s policy paper titled “Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy” released last year in March.</p><p name="75a1" id="75a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We quote:</p><p name="cb7f" id="cb7f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“In 2010 the Government stated an intent to reduce our overall nuclear warhead stockpile ceiling from not more than 225 to not more than 180 by the mid-2020s. However, in recognition of the evolving security environment, including the developing range of technological and doctrinal threats, this is no longer possible, and the UK will move to an overall nuclear weapon stockpile of no more than 260 warheads.”</p><p name="e9e6" id="e9e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The UK’s statement during the Conference of Disarmament, which took place in February this year, cited “concern” about the proliferation coming from the DPRK and Iran, as well as the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine: “Last year, the United Kingdom published our Integrated Review of Security, Defense, Foreign and Development Policy. It set out very clearly that the deteriorating security environment was a deep concern, it flagged the risks posed by new disruptive technologies, alongside long standing proliferation concerns about the activities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. However, it also pointed out the growing challenge from major nuclear armed states willing to flout international norms of behavior.”</p><p name="13a8" id="13a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They didn’t fail to mention another NATO target, Syria, and their alleged use of chemical weapons:</p><p name="eabd" id="eabd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“2022 is also a year of challenges for the control of chemical and biological weapons, where the dangers have not been dissipated. But, there are also opportunities. Let’s look towards the global stage. Syria remains defiant in its refusal to abide by its obligations on chemical weapons.”</p><p name="40c2" id="40c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The political position of the UK as a US satellite is clear. Their positions on the matter are the same. Smaller states have no right to defend themselves. Even the mere potential of one of them developing slightly more advanced weaponry evidently gives the UK the right to restart the Arms Race. They indirectly say as much in the original paper:</p><p name="8541" id="8541" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The UK will not use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 1968 (NPT). This assurance does not apply to any state in material breach of those non-proliferation obligations. However, we reserve the right to review this assurance if the future threat of weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical and biological capabilities, or emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact, makes it necessary.”</p><p name="1c6a" id="1c6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">References to the NPT are a farce, as their recent AUKUS security deal with the US and Australia itself breaches it.</p><p name="353d" id="353d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And not only this, but after 14 years of removing all US nukes from their soil, the UK is now again set to house them next year. The reason stated was concerns about Russia. The Biden administration added the UK and other NATO members as recipients, set for delivery by 2023:</p><p name="a3ac" id="a3ac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“In addition, NATO funds infrastructure required to store special weapons within secure sites and facilities. NATO is wrapping up a thirteen-year, $384 million infrastructure investment program at storage sites in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and Turkey to upgrade security measures, communication systems, and facilities.”</p><p name="d728" id="d728" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And while nuclear convoys travel freely across UK highways; they, along France and the US, are still urging besieged states not to act. The new western bloc statement regarding the Non-Proliferation Treaty titled “Ministerial Statement of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America “ states:</p><p name="ceb7" id="ceb7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We reiterate that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. We regret that, despite intense diplomatic efforts, Iran has yet to seize the opportunity to restore full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). We urge Iran to return to full implementation of the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 and to cooperate on an urgent basis with the IAEA in resolving questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran as required under its NPT-required safeguards agreement. We further note that continued advances in the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs pose a growing threat to our common security. We remain committed to complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement by the DPRK of all its nuclear weapons and call on the DPRK to cease all nuclear tests and launches that use ballistic missile technology and related activities as required under multiple UN Security Council resolutions.”</p><p name="f342" id="f342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And regarding Russia:</p><p name="bdf5" id="bdf5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Following Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine, we call on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior, to uphold its international commitments, and to recommit — in words and deeds — to the principles enshrined in the recent Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races Leaders’ statement.”</p><p name="f374" id="f374" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The United Kingdom’s national security adviser, Stephen Lovegrove says that the backdoor communication channels that existed during the Cold War to help ease high tension situations no longer exist, and that thus the threat of nuclear war has increased.</p><p name="175b" id="175b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NATO, for the first time in decades, is feeling threatened. They seemingly no longer have sway on their targeted countries (from sanctions, infiltration, sabotage etc.) as they did in the past. The era of unipolarity has finally reached its end.</p><p name="3861" id="3861" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arso Markovic 5/8/2022</p><p name="b345" id="b345" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Opinions stated should be taken as those</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">of the author and not the organization unless stated otherwise.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="a601" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f8ec" id="f8ec" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/05/the-nuclear-rearmament-of-uk/?preview=true" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/05/the-nuclear-rearmament-of-uk/?preview=true" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on August 5, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
