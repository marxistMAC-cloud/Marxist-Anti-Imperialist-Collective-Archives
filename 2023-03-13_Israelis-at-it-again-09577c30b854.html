As the Russian-Ukrainian war has escalated, the ongoing world economic crisis is deepening, and our lives are worsening. Of course during these difficult times the zionists never forget their old habits and have committed terrible crimes once again.</p><p name="10b1" id="10b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To begin with, the month of February 2023 will be remembered for the extremely deadly earthquake in Türkiye. Many countries sent help and rescue teams and amongst them the illegitimate state of Israel did as well. The Isrealis normally couldn’t just help and then leave as every other rescue team did. When they “helped”, they found and then decided to steal two antique scrolls of the Book of Esther, a historical manuscript of the Torah (2 centuries old). According to them an old man simply offered it to them in order to be kept safe. Even if we believe their story there is the question of why they didn’t report it to the Turkish authorities? I am sure that there are more than enough spaces in Istanbul or Ankara for this document to be kept safely. Of course, after the outrage of the Turkish nation during their crisis they returned the manuscript and obviously they didn’t apologize (or at least I wasn’t able to find an official apology).</p><figure name="6d0e" id="6d0e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*bDLIqBGE4Vm8eEAh" data-width="373" data-height="195" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bDLIqBGE4Vm8eEAh"></figure><p name="36ae" id="36ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">But the Israelis didn’t stop with their surprises, out of the blue and for no apparent reason, they bombed Damascus, the capital of the already war-torn Syria killing 15 people. There has been that the strike was against Hezbollah and according to Iranian news agency Tasnim, the strikes hit “exactly the spot” where Hezbollah’s top commander Imad Mughniyeh was killed in a 2008 car bombing. This unprovoked aggression also led to the destruction of a 10-storey building in the Kafr Sousa district that houses Syrian Intelligence offices according to the “Observatory”. On top of all this, a woman was killed in the Mazraa district possibly due to the impact of Syrian anti-craft munitions.</p><figure name="d618" id="d618" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*D7v0FJX-POKUZRDt" data-width="776" data-height="548" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*D7v0FJX-POKUZRDt"></figure><p name="4919" id="4919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Continuing the reports of Israeli terror, in Nablus in the West Bank, an unusual daytime attack by the IDF took place. According to the IDF the reason for this attack was an operation to “neutralize” 3 suspects that “were planning attacks in the near future”. Along with the 3 suspects the Zionist soldiers killed another 11 Palestinians and injured 100 more. According to Ahmad Jibril, the local director of Red Crescent the attack took place at “a time when everyone is out shopping in the open market of the old city.” He stated that “People who were unarmed and even away from the old city were also shot. Bullets were everywhere!”. So, we are supposed to believe that one of the best and most sophisticated armed forces in the world needed to injure 100 people and kill another 9 in order to “neutralize” 3 suspects? According to Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, the main IDF international spokesman, this massacre took place because the Palestinians resisted with huge intensity, so they had to launch rockets. Of course, the 72-year- old that was killed along the way was resisting with “huge intensity”. Later, Dinar from the IDF responded to claims that the soldiers didn’t allow for medical help to arrive for the unarmed population “I am not familiar with such behavior and I hope it did not happen. If they have evidence, let us know and we will take it to the commanders.” the usual “We investigated ourselves and we found ourselves not guilty!”</p><figure name="b1aa" id="b1aa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*r3ScQSHGkhev2qcQ" data-width="555" data-height="311" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*r3ScQSHGkhev2qcQ"></figure><figure name="50c3" id="50c3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rvbdOlw1huteYRCf" data-width="559" data-height="370" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rvbdOlw1huteYRCf"></figure><p name="7bd0" id="7bd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The Zionists continue their usual habits of destruction, murder and theft every minute that passes by every chance they get at every place they can. Whether it is Türkiye, Syria or Palestine they treat all “goyims” the same.</p><p name="8091" id="8091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Platon Stafa, 13/3/2023</p><figure name="60ca" id="60ca" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*18BwA2LXNuYuLku2" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*18BwA2LXNuYuLku2"></figure><p name="cfd0" id="cfd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="d4e5" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="76d0" id="76d0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/03/13/israelis-at-it-again/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/03/13/israelis-at-it-again/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on March 13, 2023.</em></p></div></div></section>
