Explosions of anger in cities, growing feelings of insecurity, resurgence of racism,… many people are wondering about one issue: immigration. The right and the extreme right, which we resolutely fight, seek to stir up hatred against immigrants. Beyond that, has immigration become a real problem today? Our answer is </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">YES</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="8543" id="8543" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Why do so many immigrants come to our country?</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="961a" id="961a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">There have always been immigrants in France, for a wide variety of reasons, many of whom have chosen to stay in our country. Many families, originally immigrants, have become part of the French people.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="dc3c" id="dc3c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Today it is essentially the appalling misery of the Third World that forces men, women and young people to come and try to live in a developed country like ours.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="98d5" id="98d5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">This immigration is all the stronger as it is organised: the bosses find cheap labor there. The policy followed by the governments has led to the regrouping of many immigrant families in the suburbs, the popular housing estates. Thus all the difficulties resulting from the crisis, from unemployment, from exclusion, from inequalities have been accumulated in veritable city-ghettos, where French and immigrant families are seeing their living conditions worsen intolerably.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="04f9" id="04f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">While all new immigration should have been stopped long ago (the Communists have been saying this since 1974), illegal immigration is organized in defiance of the law. Bosses find their interest in it by cynically over-exploiting these workers, whom smugglers and landlords hold to ransom. All governments have turned a blind eye to these despicable practices which continue to increase the number of immigrants in our country.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="133c" id="133c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Can France continue to welcome new immigrants? NO!</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="0d2c" id="0d2c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">With 3.5 million unemployed, we must stop all new immigration, it is the common interest of French and immigrant workers. For this, it is necessary to severely sanction those who allow, organize and use illegal immigration (employers, labor merchants, smugglers, lodgers, etc.). Agreements must be concluded with all immigration countries for stricter control of the exits and returns of their nationals. More generally, we must commit without delay to a new polic putting an end to the pillage of the peoples of the Third World, helping their own development, making it possible to find a lasting solution of mutual interest to the painful problem of immigration.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="ec81" id="ec81" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Aren’t there abuses in the use of French law which allows family reunification? Yes, they should be deleted.</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="a972" id="a972" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">An immigrant must have the free choice to stay in France or to return to his country. If he decides to live in France, it is normal that he can live there with his family provided that it is in compliance with French law, with the same rights and the same duties as the other inhabitants of the country. This is not always the case. Some use the current conditions to gather uncontrolled under the same roof a large number of adults and children hiding one illegal immigration. The right to family reunification must therefore be guaranteed, but controlled and rigorously controlled in its application.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="a85f" id="a85f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">An immigrant can also decide to return to his country. New agreements based on mutual interest with the countries of origin should enable him to succeed in his reintegration.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="8425" id="8425" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Does the existence of a large immigrant population in the same city not lead to imbalances in the use of municipal resources which dissatisfy other layers of the population? Yes, and it needs to be fixed.</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="a4cc" id="a4cc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Immigrant families are often the largest and the poorest. They are therefore among the first to benefit from the aid granted to the most deprived. It is an important part of the social budget of the municipality — already too limited — which is thus spent. Access to certain services or equipment is made more difficult for others, because it is too expensive. It is this situation which cannot last any longer that the elected officials in many popular communes are confronted with. It is therefore necessary to ensure the construction of social housing for French and immigrant families in all the cities where there is a shortage in order to stop the creation of cities or ghetto-districts Without delay, the State must provide exceptional means to the municipalities facing these difficulties. so that everywhere we can help all the families who need it.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="5050" id="5050" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Drugs, violence, delinquency: should we close our eyes when immigrants are involved in order not to be treated as racist? Absolutely not.</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="5d9f" id="5d9f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">To be racist is to claim that immigrants are the cause of everything from unemployment, to austerity, to insecurity, to drug trafficking,… It’s absurd, monstrous, criminal… But that does not mean that none of them could in principle be guilty of anything. On the contrary, we have been saying, and for a long time, that between French people and immigrants what applies is the same rights rule, but also the same homework.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="6cfa" id="6cfa" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In this sense, respect for the tranquility of people, traditions and the French way of life since we are in France, the rights and duties of living together is a requirement that is imposed on all and that does not allow any exception. . The security of persons and property is an essential right, and the public forces, for which this is their priority mission, must have the means necessary to ensure it Drugs are a scourge which must be fought through information, prevention and care, but also by repression against traffickers, whoever they are.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="b640" id="b640" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Should we take our anger out on immigrants, scapegoating them for the evils that plague our country? No, we have to change the policy</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="0052" id="0052" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It is not because immigrants occupy too many jobs that there is unemployment, it is because the government’s policy is aligned with employers’ choices of layoffs and job insecurity.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="4521" id="4521" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It is not because immigrants receive too much Social Security that it is in deficit-they contribute to it in the same way as other employees, it is because there is too much unemployment, that wages are too low and finance revenues are exempt from contributions.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="fd6a" id="fd6a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It is not because immigrant families occupy too many public housing units that we lack it, it is because we did not build enough social housing, because of government policy and the choices of many right-wing municipalities. It is not by inflicting additional discrimination on immigrants that we will extend the rights of the French, it is by widening for each other economic and social rights, individual and collective freedoms.We resolutely fight the poison of racism distilled by the right and the extreme right, which aims to pit French people and immigrants against each other, to divide the victims of the same policy. We call to come together and act for a new policy, using the wealth of France no longer for the benefit of the privileged few but for employment, training, health, housing, etc. It is the implementation of such a policy which will undermine the bases of racism and xenophobia and will allow tolerance, mutual respect to prevail.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="25c7" id="25c7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Faced with the difficult and dangerous situation experienced by many municipalities, activists and the elected Communists demand an exceptional effort from the government. They are available everywhere so that dialogue prevails and allows us to act together to obtain the means to solve the problems that populations are facing.</em></strong></blockquote><p name="34a6" id="34a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Translated by Gracchus Jadid, 25/9/2022</p><figure name="5ef3" id="5ef3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*O_gBvXRsqL1AmZcS" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*O_gBvXRsqL1AmZcS"></figure></div></div></section><section name="3c2d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="8c01" id="8c01" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/09/25/an-original-english-translation-of-a-pcf-leaflet-on-immigration/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/09/25/an-original-english-translation-of-a-pcf-leaflet-on-immigration/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on September 25, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
