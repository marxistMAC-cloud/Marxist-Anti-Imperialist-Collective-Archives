The right wing ideologists have a different understanding of the situation, though. According to them, leftists should stop whining about their socio-economic status and take responsibility for their lives. Once leftists do this, and take some steps that are required for success, they will stop being leftists, since they will see first hand that hard work does enable you to climb the social ladder. This would, of course, work in labor aristocratic countries where “left” is just a bunch of privileged people demanding yet more privileges to be afforded to them. But, the right wing message is not reserved to them exclusively. It’s an argument that bourgeoisie is making against the left worldwide. Does it work outside labor aristocracy? Can an actual proleter succeed in life “pulling himself by the bootstraps” and then adopt bourgeois ideology? We often here such stories. But, sometimes it goes a little different than that.</p><p name="6754" id="6754" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Andrew Tate is a man who climbed the social ladder very high, starting from very low. But, that did not make him say “oh, look, the world is fair after all”. No, he succeeded precisely because he understood how the system works. He understood that it’s about exploitation. And he decided to get wealthy — by exploiting others.</p><p name="7c27" id="7c27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, he has all the justification that is needed in capitalist society — men voluntarily paid, women voluntarily did what they did (webcam modeling business). But, obviously, from socialist perspective, none of that is justified. Not only is that exploitation in a financial sense, it’s exploitation of women in the sense that it pushes them to do immoral things. Things that Tate himself would consider unworthy of a woman that she respects her self.</p><p name="46a5" id="46a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is similar to a phenomenon we see with many men — wanting to sleep with as much women as they can, yet wanting their own woman to not only be faithful during their relationship, but also to not have had sex with many men before — “low body count”. Obviously, this can’t work on a societal level. The math doesn’t add up. So, this is clearly not meant as a solution on a societal level. It’s meant as competitive game, where strong, high quality men triumph and get lots of sex, despite the fact that women are avoiding to have sex with too much men.</p><p name="50b1" id="50b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This brings us to Tate’s main message to men: discipline yourself, don’t be weak. You need to compete against other men and win. There’s no time to be depressed, or chase happiness, it doesn’t matter if you feel good or bad. Just go, do your training, do everything you need to do to succeed in every area. There’s no time to be wasted on being weak. This is necessary to have money, have good physique and have access to high quality women.</p><p name="4807" id="4807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are some quotes of his:</p><blockquote name="dd7d" id="dd7d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I think a man should have no interest in whether he is actually happy or not. If I wake up unhappy, I will do the exact same things as if I’m happy. I will go to the gym the same. I will work the same. How I feel has no impact on how I live my life. I don’t think happiness as an index is a healthy view for a man to have on life success.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="ce77" id="ce77" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">People who train every day don’t want to train every day. They are not motivated to train every day. They are something else. Motivation is the wrong word. They are not motivated. They are disciplined. Disciplined. Every fucking day, I do things that I don’t feel like doing. It’s called discipline. It’s called being a man. It’s not about feeling like doing it. If you only do things that you feel like doing, do you know what you end up doing? Sitting around all day with a belly, drinking fucking late bullshit. You have to say “I don’t feel like training, but I must train. I will watch Tate speech. I will stop being a looser.”</em></blockquote><blockquote name="5804" id="5804" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">People say “Oh, you know, I have confidence issues” and I say “ Yeah, if I was you, I would have confidence issues, of course I completely understand why you have confidence issues, you are a dork. Confidence comes from competence. The world is competitive, and there’s men like me on the planet, and friends like mine on the planet, and you are competing with us for money, for girls, for status, for resources. And, you are going to be destroyed and decimated the entire time. So, yeah, of course you have confidence issues when you are going to be annihilated in real time by competitor. Why wouldn’t you have confidence issues? You would ne psychopathic not to.” So, yeah, maybe that lack of confidence is a good motivation for them.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="74ca" id="74ca" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It doesn’t matter if the man slept with 20 girls or 200 girls, he is still the man. If a woman slept with 200 men, she is worthless. This is the basis of the game. No man is going to marry a woman that 200 men slammed and threw to the street. The problem with the Western world, especially America, is that women think they have some kind of power. “Oh, I will go sleep with a guy”. You didn’t fuck the guy. The guy fucked you.</em></blockquote><p name="36bc" id="36bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Other than encouraging ego based competition mentality (as opposed to collectivist minded friendly competition, such as Stakhanovite movement), and condoning male promiscuity, Tate’s message is essentially correct: Men need to have bigger responsibility for providing, women should have bigger responsibility for raising children. Women should not be promiscuous. Men should be disciplined.</p><p name="5164" id="5164" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Western culture generally encourages people to abandon normal values, and put pleasure and hedonism in the first place. To not really care about long term consequences, nor about putting children and families as central social value. This is clearly being pushed by the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie and we should welcome everyone who is willing to oppose it. And Tate is one of those people.</p><blockquote name="0705" id="0705" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I know I’m a good person, and when the matrix tries to convince the world that I’m not a good person, that just proves even further that I’m a good person. The world we are living today, when the mass media machine tells you that someone is evil, you can know pretty well that person is good and vice versa.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="f741" id="f741" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I’m absolutely a positive influence. And that’s the problem. The key word there is influence. The key reason Matrix has attacked me is because they don’t like influence, because I have not sold my soul. They don’t control me. And, normally, when you get massively influential, they control you. You either sign a contract, or your sponsor or your manager. They have some sort of leverage over you, to make sure you only say what you are supposed to say. I’m an individual which they do not control. I have a massive influence over the population of Earth. Yeah, and when you have someone like me who is principled, who has morals, who believes in God, who will not sell his soul, who will not promote degeneracy and who also has a mass influence, they see me as a threat. Because they say “There are certain agenda that he will not promote, because of his morality, and we need immoral people who have sold their souls absolutely and completely, so they’ll enforce the slave programming amongst the population.” So, they see me as a threat and me being a positive influence in and of itself is also a threat to establishment, because they don’t want people to be happy. They want you to be semi-depressed and sad and miserable. Because when you are sad, you are self-obsessed and distracted. You are sitting at home “ me me me”, you are very selfish. When you are sad, you don’t care about you community, you don’t care about your country, you don’t care about injustices in the world. When you are sad, you don’t care about trying to actually go and make world a better place, because you are too busy thinking about yourself. So, they want you miserable, semi-depressed and unhappy, because they want you to sit at home and accept them doing whatever they want to do to the planet and other people, without ever talking or standing up or doing the right thing.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="2602" id="2602" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">from his interview for The Ahmad Mahmood show</em></blockquote><p name="06a8" id="06a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He doesn’t seem interested in falling in line and censoring himself. Maybe because of his background of poverty, and because of his competitive mindset. His values resemble those of pre-monopoly capitalism and, given that we don’t live in the 19th century, one has to be really, really competitive and disciplined to hold such outlook regardless of different eras.</p><p name="29c4" id="29c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, let’s examine where socialists disagree with Tate:</p><p name="ca57" id="ca57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1) Male promiscuity — Yes, every culture that has proclaimed monogamy, only rigorously enforced it on women, not on men. But, that’s based on private property inheritance that goes by male line. In a socialist society, that wouldn’t make sense any more, so monogamy could be enforced equally on both genders. Of course, we wouldn’t want to make women as promiscuous as men, we want men to be as monogamous as women.</p><p name="f031" id="f031" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, why can’t we just go back to before the Matrix took over — to pre-monopoly capitalism and pre-postmodern culture? Why can’t we go back to a system where female monogamy, and other family values, were strictly enforced, without going socialist and enforcing male monogamy too?</p><p name="408f" id="408f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because pre-monopoly capitalism necessarily leads to development of monopoly. Market competition enables those who are better at it to get ever stronger influence on the market, and, eventually, eliminate their competition.</p><p name="3b56" id="3b56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Monopoly capitalism necessarily tends for capital to be exported abroad. Domestic population won’t tolerate exploitation by the monopoly system for very long. Exploitation needs to be exported abroad, and the domestic population appeased by concessions.</p><p name="3caf" id="3caf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once the domestic population is appeased instead of exploited, the system has no more use in domestic population’s procreation, so it will necessarily turn to abolishing family values.</p><p name="b6ed" id="b6ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we were to somehow move back to pre-monopoly capitalism and its cultural superstructure (traditional family values — female monogamy strictly enforced, male monogamy only nominally enforced), it would once again develop to the same point we live today.</p><p name="1895" id="1895" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2) Ego based competitive mindset — Discipline, focus and devotion to higher goals are, indeed, essential for man’s mental well-being and his usefulness to society. But, in socialist society, we wouldn’t want to encourage an ego based competitive mindset. A man should seek to discipline himself not by desire to gratify his ego, but with desire to build a better future, a new communist society together with them.</p><blockquote name="5dc8" id="5dc8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Why would you train or work hard, if you don’t have an ego? If you don’t have an ego, and you are not all about me and what I am, and who I am, why would you even care? People without ego are the lazy people. “Oh, I’m fat, but I don’t care”, “I don’t have a nice car. I don’t care.”</em></blockquote><p name="df42" id="df42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Stakhanovite movement tells us differently.</p><blockquote name="daf3" id="daf3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The term Stakhanovite (стахановец) originated in the Soviet Union and referred to workers who modeled themselves after Alexey Stakhanov. These workers took pride in their ability to produce more than was required, by working harder and more efficiently, thus strengthening the socialist state.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="d4c1" id="d4c1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">From wikipedia</em></blockquote><p name="3235" id="3235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Life experience also tells us that men will often pride themselves in accomplishing something useful for the collective. It doesn’t have to be for ego, for status nor for women.</p><p name="2f0c" id="2f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In proletarian society, there’s no reason for women to choose men based on their wealth or status, because there is no wealth, and everyone has the same status, fundamentally. So, Tate’s message is, essentially, one that is appropriate to capitalist society, not to socialist one.</p><p name="0410" id="0410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Encouraging ego based competitive mindset leaves us with the idea that whoever is stronger has the right to exploit the weaker. We see a lot of this on the international level, where patsocs, and many other socialists, propose the idea that only the nations that are strong enough to win a fight for their statehood deserve an independent state. But, we shouldn’t encourage nations to compete against one another in who will conquer, submit and, ultimately, assimilate weaker nations. Being able to control smaller or weaker nations should not be a flex. Might doesn’t make right.</p><p name="cd97" id="cd97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, do we not have any use from rivalry and a stronger, unfriendly, competitive mentality? There is one useful purpose — we can threat imperialists, and bourgeoisie in general, as our rivals. Seeing what they are able and willing to do to submit global proletariat to their agenda, can inspire in us the desire to submit them to ourselves — to the global masses. We can be competitive against them and try to make ourselves as strong as possible to be able to fight them. Building a red army starts with personal discipline. When men have enough discipline and commitment they build armies:</p><blockquote name="0edb" id="0edb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Men are designed to be in ARMIES. GANGS. We’ve evolved to feel invincible amongst the battle cry of our peers. To be ready TO FIGHT AND TO DIE. Brutal tenacity took me from social housing to hundreds of millions. To 4x kickboxing world champion. YOU NEED MEN AROUND YOU.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="99da" id="99da" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Andrew Tate’s twitter</em></blockquote><p name="603f" id="603f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">N.
