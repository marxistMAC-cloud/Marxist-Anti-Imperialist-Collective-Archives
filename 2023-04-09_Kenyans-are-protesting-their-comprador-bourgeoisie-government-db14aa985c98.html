British colony of East Africa, against the current liberal and Christian fundamentalist president William Ruto, who has promised massive privatisations for the next months, who also has been accused of electoral fraud by the social-democrat candidate Raila Odinga. William Ruto was completely molded by Daniel Arap Moi’s comprador autocracy, supported by the Western Imperialists against Communism and Anti-Imperialism, and saw in this West-backed dictatorship that he met several times a “mentor” ; he was Vice President under Uhuru Kenyatta, a puppet of America and England, linked to the Pandora Papers affair.</p><p name="6d1a" id="6d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like explained by the Kenyan newspaper The Elephant :</p><blockquote name="a246" id="a246" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">For the past 60 years, this elite network has remained well resourced and networked and is as a result both resilient and stable. This in turn has contributed to the peace and stability Kenya has enjoyed. Even when this elite has had internal squabbles, which have regularly led to episodic violence in the country, they have been mediated through elite “handshakes” — essentially boardroom deals. Like the English aristocracy of old, unwritten rules of engagement govern their game of thrones (…) We are therefore encouraged to observe that the current political stalemate between the opposition and the government might not be the usual Kenyan intra-elite dispute but a more fundamental contest between two orders. The first, an order that over the life of the postcolonial state has entrenched itself and feels entitled to the spoils of the state. The second, a new order that feels that the old guard has had its time and should make way for it.</em></blockquote><p name="855c" id="855c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This comprador bourgeois dictatorship is desesperate against people’s revolt that it tried a heavy response against those protests, believing sincerely that arrests can stop an uprising of this style! We are sure that some of our readers will ask themselves “What are the Kenyans communists doing?” Well, for what we’ve seen, there was a brief split when fundamental members of the organization decided to support William Ruto against the Party’s majority. According to the remaining members of the Organization :</p><blockquote name="8946" id="8946" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Party came under attack when two of its senior officials joined one of the two leading political coalitions during the 2022 elections campaigns, which went against Party regulations and the 2022 CPK election guidelines. Mghanga and Wachira broke off to join the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, the coalition that thrust President William Ruto into power. (…) The Party’s pre-election analysis concluded that both principal leading candidates: Ruto with Kenya Kwanza and Raila with Azimio, were comprador bourgeoisie and had nothing to offer the working class and the poor. In them, corruption, nepotism, tribalism and all the backward ideas of the old society reign. (…) Following the split, Mghanga and Wachira justified their decision to join the openly Right-Wing, Christian fondamentalist coalition. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">They called it the natural flow of things as they went where the people were.</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> In a most fantastical tale responding to a member’s demand for an explanation, they exalted the move as one of those enemies-to-lovers’ tropes.</em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> Wachira explained how he would use his presence to swoop in and save the masses from under Ruto and bring them to the Left!</em></strong></blockquote><p name="177b" id="177b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We can remark that the argument of the members was completely populistic and pseudo-pro- masses one without any ways of seeing the actual logic and fullest conclusion of this presumption.</p><p name="4bef" id="4bef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only problem that I can find in the article from the remaining members is the argument : instead of being around the fact that William Ruto represents comprador bourgeoisie completely submitted to Imperialism like his mentor and his boss were, they use the fact that he is “right- wing conservative”</p><p name="5aa5" id="5aa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The KPC doesn’t understand that it isn’t the subject, that the Right-Left dichotomy is constructed around the relationship to Imperialism.</p><p name="304e" id="304e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding the rest, we can hope that revolutionary masses will not keep their mouth shut, coordinate their actions and fight against the Imperialists and their lackeys in the Great War of Liberation that is going in Africa, touching Françafrique in the West of the continent and also East.</p><p name="c6b9" id="c6b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">G.
