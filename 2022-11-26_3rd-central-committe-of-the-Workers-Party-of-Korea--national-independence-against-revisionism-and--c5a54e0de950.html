We don’t need to explain to our dear readers the fact that we regard Korea as the currently most advanced socialist society in the current world, and, despite obvious critiques against some of their theories, consider them with high respect.</p><p name="05f0" id="05f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many people, even people calling themselves communists, criticize Socialist Korea for its isolation, the fact that, contrary to many current or past proletarian governments, it remains confined, even from the “anti-imperialist world”.</p><p name="7f42" id="7f42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They want to make Korea the new Cuba : a place where all the tourists from the Imperial global centers will gladly come to have relationships with some prostitutes, giving some money for an easy funny sensual night.</p><p name="ac22" id="ac22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main question should be : for what reason did DPRK choose isolation? This question can have many answers from the various numbers of intellectuals : the Korean Revolutionaries being nationalists since their resistance against Japanese imperialism and chauvinism, and then Soviet and Chinese chauvinism, states both located near the Korean frontier making Korea able to “play” diplomatic games with both much easier than Romania, or simply the impact of the criminal Imperialist war against the Korean masses, making them completely reluctant to any imperialization of their state by the Anglo labour-aristocratic people, even the most “leftists”, their parents being the responsible for the raped women of their nation.</p><p name="36f4" id="36f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But one of the events often overlooked can be found in the year 1955. This year is regarded by the editorial board of Pyongyang itself in “History of Revolutionary activities of Kim Il Sung” as the turning-point of the Juche policy for national independence.</p><p name="0385" id="0385" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During this year, inside of the Workers Party of Korea, we had a struggle between 4 groups :</p><p name="6f02" id="6f02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-The Korean communists who came from Soviet Union <br>-The Korean communists who came from China <br>-The Korean communists who came from the Southern part of the Nation <br>-The Korean communists who stayed in the North.</p><p name="215a" id="215a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each of these group claimed to represent the interests of the Soviets, the Chinese or the South. We had for example, Pak Yeong-Bin, who was one of the most trustful allies of Soviet Union, known for having publically critiqued the anti-American propaganda from DPRK, explaining to Kim-Il-Sung that this position was completely contradictive to the concept of peaceful coexistence.</p><p name="b00a" id="b00a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pak Il-U was regarded as the representative of Maoism, regarding the Korean nationalists as a rightist force and revisionist one.</p><p name="fef5" id="fef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was almost a challenge of how much someone can be submissive towards a country, we had Pak Chang Ok, a representative of the pro-Soviet faction who became pro-China and decided to progressively put “Great” in literally every of his works. Kim-Il-Sung tred to present all these people as simple bureaucrats with the goals of gaining some short term individual gain.</p><p name="a0a0" id="a0a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the most interesting criticism made by Kim on the need to educate the young cadres is the following:</p><blockquote name="f1ab" id="f1ab" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Some of our young cadres, however, know the general theory of Marxism well, but do not know our history, whereas those who are well-read in ancient books do not have sufficient knowledge of Marxist theory. You should not call yourself a genuine historian simply because you know a lot about ancient times. Only when we have a correct knowledge of Marxism and are versed in the history of our country can we correctly analyse history at each stage in a Marxist way, in other words, make a correct analysis to determine which section of society is our enemy and which section is for the revolution and to be clear on the balance of forces between ourselves and the enemy at each stage of our social development.</em></blockquote><p name="218f" id="218f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He understood the reality of factionalism inside of his party : a religius way of seeing Marxism and submission to the foreigners.</p><p name="98f4" id="98f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also outlines it during his work “On eliminating Flunkeyism and Dogmatism” :</p><blockquote name="2837" id="2837" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Once I visited a People’s Army rest home, where there was a picture of the Siberian steppe on the wall. Russians probably like that landscape. But we Korean people like the beautiful scenery of our own country. (…) One day this summer when I dropped in at a local democratic publicity hall, I saw diagrams of the Soviet Union’s Five-Year Plan on show there, but not a single diagram illustrating our own Three-Year Plan. Moreover, there were pictures of huge factories in foreign countries, but not a single one of the factories we are rebuilding. They do not even put up any diagrams and pictures showing our economic construction, let alone study the history of our country.</em></blockquote><p name="5455" id="5455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese forces got allied against Kim-Il-Sung because they firstly didn’t know anything about Korean history and culture, and were secondly, submitted to another state, and it just a was a matter of time before one of these factions would betray Socialism. But there is act and reaction, and the Korean communists acted, with one of their main acts being, according to the Pyongyang Editorial Board:</p><blockquote name="2db8" id="2db8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In the summer of 1956, while touring the USSR and Eastern European socialist countries, he declared that if Korea promoted socialist construction successfully by displaying self-reliance, it would indicate its faithfulness to internationalism, even though it did not enter the CMEA (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Afterwards, he invariably opposed the country’s entry into the CMEA and held fast to the line of building an independent national economy.</em></blockquote><p name="ea17" id="ea17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">One of the greatest crimes ever done against the factions which were built on dependance to USSR!</p><p name="2e0f" id="2e0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These factions started an alliance against Kim-Il Sung, mimicking the anti-Stalin speech from the renegade Krushev (yes, Maoists will imitate it!) even denouncing the concept of Dictatorship of the Proletariat (I must repeat, pro-China factions participated in this). This gave a fantastic justification for Kim Il Sung to purge all the foreign elements of his party with all the support of the masses, being firstly nationalists, putting steady a path of full self-reliance and independence, which was proved right and neccesary through the experience on the Ceylon Revolution, or the Khmers Rouge.</p><p name="7676" id="7676" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This event finally teached us three fundamental things :</p><p name="b5b8" id="b5b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. China and Soviet Union started to see to a certain degree the other socialists states as pawns even before the 70s.</p><p name="c5cb" id="c5cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. The nationalists masses will always choose National independence over any other concept, such as dogmatism or revisionism.</p><p name="108b" id="108b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. The Maoists have for the most part, no ideology apart short-term interests and racialists tendancies.</p><p name="69fb" id="69fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gracccus Jadid 26/11/2022</p><figure name="521f" id="521f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*PkXYsDIrKFwpLY-E" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PkXYsDIrKFwpLY-E"></figure><p name="e172" id="e172" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="6dc9" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="90cf" id="90cf" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/11/26/3rd-central-committe-of-the-workers-party-of-korea-national-independence-against-revisionism-and-dogmatism/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/11/26/3rd-central-committe-of-the-workers-party-of-korea-national-independence-against-revisionism-and-dogmatism/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on November 26, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
