Such a description is essential both in regard to theory, because, from the standpoint of the basic ideas of Marxism, the interests of social development are higher than the interests of the proletariat-the interests of the working-class movement as a whole are higher than the interests of a separate section of the workers or of separate phases of the movement; and in regard to practice, the elucidation is essential because of the need to characterise the focal point to which all the variety of Social-Democratic activity-propaganda, agitation, and organisation-must be directed and round which it must be concentrated. </em>In addition<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">, we think a special paragraph of the programme should be devoted to the provision that the Social-Democratic working-class party set itself the </em>aim<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> of supporting every revolutionary movement against the autocracy and the struggle against all attempts on the part of the autocratic government to corrupt and befog the political consciousness of the people by means of bureaucratic guardianship and sham doles, by means of that demagogic policy which our German comrades have called the </em>“Peitsche und Zuckerbrot”<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> policy (whip and biscuit policy).</em></blockquote><p name="4922" id="4922" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We see here three main points being brought up. First, that the first immediate task of the proletarian party should be the overthrow of the autocracy, and this is not only for the interests of the proletariat, but for the interests of the society and its development as a whole. Second, just like the general interests of the working class are higher than the interests of a specific section of it, just like that, the interests of the whole society are higher than the specific interests of the working class. Third, the proletariat party must support <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">every </em>anti-autocratic movement.</p><p name="637e" id="637e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To deconstruct what we just wrote, we need to take the logic and unveil it.</p><p name="c708" id="c708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, there is a situation in Russia in 1899. Of course, the situation is not homogeneous in the entirety of the Russian empire; the Russian empire <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is not a nation</em>. It is a state. The state is ruled by the Russian aristocracy, and since currently, the Russian aristocracy represent the Russian nation (they rule it, and the Russian nation allows it to be in power for whatever reason), at the helm of the Russian empire we find the Russian nation. Immediately, therefore, we arrive to the conclusion that we have a different situation depending on the national territory we live in; we of course have other separations inside Russia, class ones, territorial ones, urban/rural ones, sex ones (women/men), e.t.c. But the important thing we need to keep is that we have a national division, and before the reader thinks that we don’t highlight the class division, we will explain later, for now we ask the reader to bear with us.</p><p name="e6f1" id="e6f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to Lenin, the Russian aristocracy represents a backwards class, a class that has become obsolete; thus, if an obsolete and backwards class rules a nation, it necessarily hinders the development of society as a whole. Here, development is presupposed as interest, therefore whoever keeps this development behind for their own interests (in this case, the Russian aristocracy), while they do advance their own interests, they do so in the back of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">general social development</em>, and from this standpoint, they hinder the development of society, and thus are fighting against the interests of it. Therefore, according to Lenin, any non-aristocrat, by default, has interests in overthrowing the aristocracy. Not only this, but the immediate enemy is not the bourgeoisie liberals and agrarian revolutionaries of the Narodniky type, but the aristocracy. In short, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the immediate enemy </em>is feudalism, not capitalism. This follows from the same principle we spoke before; feudalism represents the interests of a very narrow part of the population in the Russian empire of 1899, and not only this, but to prop the interests of this narrow part of the population, one needs to hinder the development<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> of the majority of the population</em>, and hence, to fight against the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">objective </em>interests of society<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> in its whole</em>.</p><p name="f04d" id="f04d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we take the proletariat, the one who<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> directly exploits</em> him is not the feudal lord, but the industrial capitalist. Most of his day he spends it in the capitalist’s factory, making him fat while he takes a small part of what he produces. In short, the capitalist robs him in his face. Still, if the proletariat dares to act, the states comes in to protect the property (robbery) of the capitalist by force. Again, the state here, when seen from the eyes of the worker in the most crude form, is not the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">independent variable</em>, but the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dependent one</em>; the independent variable is the capitalist. This of course, in the crudest way of seeing it. Reality is much more different, but is not the point to explain this here. The point is, that if the worker seeks to strike an alliance with the aristocrats against the capitalists, what does he commit? He commits an act of aggression <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">against the whole society</em> and its interests, which is to fight the autocracy. This should not be thought of as ahistorical example to the reader; this indeed did happen, and Marx in his time criticized Lassalle for having committed this error strongly (one should read the Gothakritik to see this). This is why Lenin is saying that first and foremost, the immediate task is not to overthrow (or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hinder</em>. This has been the main arena of Lenin against all other ‘legal’ marxists who had struck an alliance with the feudalists against capitalism like Lassalle did) the development of capitalism, but to overthrow the feudal aristocracy, and with the new superstructure of the bourgeoisie state, to eradicate all feudal remnants in the economy. According to Lenin’s logic, this is in the interests of the whole society, even if the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">direct interest, </em>the<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> short sighted </em>interests of the working class may be to ally with the reactionary feudals against the capitalists who rob him 12 hours + per day. In short, Lassale was acting on behalf of the direct interests of the workers, but against the general interests of society, and in extension, the general interests of the workers, too. But it is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">general </em>interests of society that are higher than the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">specific </em>interests of the proletariat. Thus, this is the logic behind the statement ‘the first and foremost enemy is the aristocracy’.</p><p name="5d6c" id="5d6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, Lenin is saying that the proletariat party needs to support <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">every </em>anti-aristocratic movement. Does this mean the party needs to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">adopt </em>their position, or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">support them in</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anything</em>? Of course not, else the proletariat party would be separated from the party of the bourgeoisie for no reason. What is to be logically meant here, is that the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie of the towns and peasantry e.t.c, need to be supported in their anti-feudal, democratic e.t.c acts, but not supported <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">insofar as they also fight the proletariat</em>; for example, the specific interest of the bourgeoisie are for strikes to be illegal; part of the general interests of not only the proletariat, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">of society</em>, is for strikes to be legal, since this is not only a proletarian demand, but also a democratic and social one, coming always with the bourgeoisie revolution either in act, or as a promise. In this instance, the proletariat party opposed the specific interest of the bourgeoisie, which goes against the general social development, but it supports the general interests of the bourgeoisie, which is the overthrown of the feudalist superstructure which hinders its business, and the destruction of feudalist remnants in the economy (blockage of migration, mass land holdings of the aristocrats still worked in the feudal way e.t.c) which hinder the development of capitalism. In short, the general interests of the bourgeoisie, in the Russia of 1899, go hand in hand with the general interests of the 1899 Russian society.</p><p name="9c65" id="9c65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">II</strong></p><p name="b525" id="b525" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Based on everything we wrote above, the conclusion is that the interest of society comes above the interests of any component subdivision of it.</p><p name="2d7a" id="2d7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, the question remains; <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what is a society</em>? If we ask 100 marxists, they will reply that society is living in the same state or having economic relations or something like this.</p><p name="92fc" id="92fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reality of the situation demands us to ask a rhetorical question: what is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">most important feature</em> of a society? What makes a society a society and not a bunch of unorganized mass of people? It is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">communication</em>. Humans aren’t wolves to communicate with howls, nor birds to communicate with chirp chirps. Humans communicate primarily with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">language</em>. Therefore, society presupposes a group of humans who can communicate by using the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">same language</em>.</p><p name="d04b" id="d04b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can therefore exist a society <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">without </em>one, single language? Not only it cannot exist, but it has not even the basic precondition for a society to be formed.</p><p name="f12c" id="f12c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is the essence of the nation? Precisely due to communication, all nations arise from linguistic differences that appear from group of peoples. We can see the history of all nations, and their future is tied with language 99 times out of 100, with the exception proving the rule. The national identity grows out of the understanding that we are different from the other; but what is this difference based on for most people of the world, who look the same to their ‘other’? It is based on culture? Religion? For most people, these don’t even play a role in adulthood, lets not even speak about the young kid to whom national consciousness is starting to take root. It is therefore, language. Language is the basis of the national identity and the nation itself. This truth was admitted by the bolsheviks, when Stalin wrote that ‘there can be no one nation speaking two languages at the same time’.</p><p name="f168" id="f168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Therefore, we arrive here to something very basic; there can be no nation with two languages, but there can also not be a society with two languages. Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that the society and the nation are in fact, for most porpuses,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> identical terms</em>.</p><p name="ea37" id="ea37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just like society, the nation is not static and closed off; it is subject to dialectical change, and the interconnections that come with it. This answers <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bilingualism </em>and how there can be Tatars working with Russians. It is because one of them choses (or was forced) to be a member of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">two societies</em>; his own, and the other’s. This <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">quantitative </em>event, of a Tatar individual choosing/or-and being forced to learn Russian to be able to live in Russian society too, may turn to a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">qualitative </em>effect if the mass of Tatars become bilingual. We will explain why.</p><p name="a9e2" id="a9e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, we have one society invading and taking control of the other with force (i.e Russians vs Tatars). The Russians and the Tatars live in the same Russian state, but in two different societies. The Russians naturally, to secure their own society, will try to destroy the society of the Tatar. Thus, we arrive to the assimilationist policies. But how are the assimilationist policies possible? They are possible <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">due to the power of the state.</em> As we said, the state is Russian, and it is in the (crude) interest of the Russian society to assimilate the Tatars and kill off their society. It gives this society more space, more people, more resources. Therefore, we arrive to the conclusion that the most basic and prime interest of the whole society-nation, is to be able to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">preserve</em> itself. To do so, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">it needs to have authority over itself</em>.</p><p name="5b5f" id="5b5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything running against the ability of the society to have authority over itself, is running against the interests of the whole society.</p><p name="52db" id="52db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since we explained that there can be no society separated from a nation, and since we further explained that the interest of society is to, obviously, preserve itself, we come to the conclusion that the first act from which a society should start to advance its general interests, is to have authority over its society, i.e over the group of people who are able to communicate with one another.</p><p name="e2a6" id="e2a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The interests of society (and nation) are in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">basics</em>, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">same</em>; none can speak of any interest, if they are unable to even have the means to fight for this interest; if they don’t have authority over their existence.</p><p name="3d46" id="3d46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence, if we consider the society as being identical with the nation, and if we follow Lenin’s logic, (which in our opinion is correct), we end up to the following conclusion: The interests of the society-nation are higher than the interests of the subgroups of this society-nation. The interests of the subgroups of the society-nation should be supported insofar as they advance the interests of the society-nation.</p><p name="6c18" id="6c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is not the interest of the specific subgroup that needs to subordinate the interests of the society-nation, but the opposite.</p><p name="e196" id="e196" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1903, Lenin wrote ‘The national question in our programme’, which forms the basis of the marxist theory of the national question after the bolsheviks and Marxism-Leninism in general. In this work, Lenin writes this:</p><blockquote name="201e" id="201e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">We do not, however, wish to confine ourselves to a formal verification of our explanation. We shall go straight to the root of the matter: is Social-Democracy in duty bound to demand national independence always and unreservedly, or only under certain circumstances; if the latter is the case then under what circumstances? To this question the P.S.P. has always replied in favour of unreserved recognition; we are not in the least surprised, therefore, at the fondness it displays towards the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, who demand a federal state system and speak in favour of “complete and unreserved recognition of the right to national self-determination” ( </em>Revolutsionnaya Rossiya<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">, №18, the article entitled “National Enslavement and Revolutionary Socialism”). Unfortunately, this is nothing more than one of those bourgeois-democratic phrases which, for the hundredth and thousandth time, reveal the true nature of the so-called Party of so-called Socialist-Revolutionaries. By falling for the bait presented by these phrases and yielding to the allurement of this clamor, the P.S.P. in its turn proves how weak in theoretical background and political activities is its link with the class struggle of the proletariat. But it is to the interests of this struggle that we must </em>subordinate<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> the demand for national self-determination. It is this that makes all the difference between our approach to the national question and the bourgeois-democratic approach. The bourgeois democrat (and the present-day socialist opportunist who follows in his footsteps) imagines that democracy eliminates the class struggle, and that is why he presents all his political demands in an abstract way, lumped together, “without reservations,” from the standpoint of the interests of the “whole people,” or even from that of an eternal and absolute moral principle. Always and every where the Social-Democrat ruthlessly exposes this bourgeois illusion, whether it finds expression in an abstract idealist philosophy or in an absolute demand for national independence.</em></blockquote><p name="a352" id="a352" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Lenin makes three points here. A) The national question must always be subordinated to the class question. B) The view that the national question must be always on the forefront, when it exists, is a bourgeoisie idea based on the bourgeoisie lie of ‘the whole people’, of the view that democracy ‘eliminates class struggle’ e.t.c. C) Socialists who say that the national self-determination must be always supported irrespective of the conditions, are in fact, closer to bourgeois radicalism than socialism.</p><p name="9626" id="9626" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Based on what we said above on nation-society, under this formula, Lenin simply contradicts himself. This happens in our opinion, because Lenin either does not understand the national question well enough (which is more than probable, almost all of his lines on the national question were proven wrong by the facts. Such was his opinion that nationalism was on demise among’s the workers — the entire immediate history of the revolution proved this wrong -, his opposition to federalism, on which he later turned around to accept it as proper, and other instances) or because he simply does not care too much for the small and oppressed nations which form most of the time the national question (which itself has a basis of truth, considering how Lenin once said that communists should not be in favor of the self-determination of small nations, but to work to include them into the multinational formation ‘on equal basis’, or his words on the amalgamation of nations — who will unite to whom? The kazakh the russian or the opposite? — e.t.c). Nonetheless, it is obvious that, as Lenin said, no class interest is above the general interest — which starts at survival — of the society, and therefore, his first point is wrong. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It is the class question that needs to be subordinated to the national question.</em> In fact, this <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is what has happened </em>historically. The sole times that communists ever won the battle for supremacy, they did so by subordinating the class question to the national question, while the bourgeoisie were doing the opposite (selling the nation for their personal benefit).</p><p name="306a" id="306a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If our proposition is wrong, and Lenin’s proposition is right, then something very, very important must be done; this is a serious re-assessment of the entire Stalinist policy which was the catalyst of all socialist societies we have seen, and in short, a whole negation of Stalinism as fundamentally wrong. If Lenin is right here, the entire logic beneath the workings of the people who led in the establishment of actually existing socialism must be denied. Because the people who led this establishment of socialism, were believers of what we are saying, that first comes the nation, then the international working class. The problem of the class inside their nation was not a problem, since they solved it by combining nationalism and communism and finding that the proletariat is the only true nationalist class in the society, thus there is no actual contradiction between the interests of the national proletariat and the interests of of society and of the nation as a whole.</p><p name="1016" id="1016" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lenin’s second point is also wrong factually. It presupposes that the men who wage national wars are either bourgeoisie, either the the working masses that have been fooled by the bourgeoisie. If every single time the masses are fooled by the bourgeoisie on this, to the point of making them turn from pro-communists to anti-communists within a decade (see eastern europe), then the idea of false consciousness is true, and Hegel was right. For this to be true, it means that the marxist understanding of the society, that corresponding ideologies correspond in general to specific classes, is wrong. Revolution is also wrong, because we can gradually convince the bourgeoisie to transition to socialism peacefully by using rational arguments, i.e make them false conscious till they disappear just like the bourgeoisie — implied by Lenin- managed to fool the entire working masses for entire generations regarding the importance of the national question.</p><p name="1a98" id="1a98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The third point of Lenin results in the result of the first point. If this is true, the entire history of actually existing socialism must be reassessed. All these societies were not homogenous among one another, especially on the view of the national question, but all of them had this common characteristic: all were nationalist. The more radical their period, the more nationalistic they were. Not only this, but the<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> sole debate </em>that can be made, is not if X or Y society had a nationalistic thinking proletariat to one degree or another, but to what degree they were nationalistic. Were they nationalistic to a degree <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where nationalism is transformed to chauvinism</em>, or to a degree where it still remained proletarian nationalism that was compatible with proper internationalism? The fact remains; only multinational states turned to chauvinism, with the facts showing that the more multinational a state was, the more the trend was that the biggest nation’s masses (if not most or all nations) were moving (and moving still today) to chauvinist positions and thinking.</p><p name="f499" id="f499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, this 3rd point of Lenin is also wrong (although his critique of bourgeoisie radicals is correct, his wrong is to compare this to how the proletariat views the national question).</p><p name="c492" id="c492" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">***</strong></p><p name="b2f7" id="b2f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is not at all exhausted here. We present here not just a critique of Great Lenin, but also an introduction of a reassessment of what is the nation, and its relation to society. If i had to give one, final concluding remark, it would be that while a society does not exist without a nation in its basis,<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> this does not exclude a nation holding multiple societies</em>, i.e a nation always is a presupposition for a society, the nation does not equal necessarily the society itself. Such is the case with most splintered nations. This division is not in contradiction with the fact that these are one nation, but in fact, it further reinforced this opinion. It only shows that the general trend of all these societies is to merge into one, and have the society correspond to the nation. This drive is the manifestation of the general interest of society, which is the unity of the nation into one society, so its resources, land, population e.t.c, become bigger, and thus its survival as a social entity is further ensured. In his light, one of the primal objectives for the communists of the world, should be the reunification of their nation into one, single society, since such an arrangement is in the general interests of their society as a whole.</p><p name="334d" id="334d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only debate that can be done here, is which class is possible to achieve this, and what class alliances and to what degree are able to do this. One thing is certain: if we understand that in reality, in our modern world, all these different societies which are one nation, are capitalist societies with the bourgeoisie as the leading class, we understand that the interests of the leaders of these societies are contradicting. At best, only when pressure of bellow is high enough, could these bourgeoisie forced to accept an arrangement for unity. The example of Arabia and Hispanoamericana, prove that the national bourgeoisie is capable of becoming a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">potential </em>force for this primal, general interest of society, only when there is push from the working masses to them. But these examples also prove, that this more than usually, remains an ‘arrangement’ mostly in words, and not deeds. The general lesson is that if the communists surrender the national question, they surrender their society. And if this happens, one cannot wonder why many workers hate them and despise them, and opt to follow conservative/populist bourgeoisie politicians who are plants of the governing circles to fool the masses every time the masses are about to do ‘reforms from below’.</p><p name="24dd" id="24dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F.
