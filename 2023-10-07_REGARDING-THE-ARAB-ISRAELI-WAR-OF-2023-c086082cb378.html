Some figures, particularly from the Western “left”, with a petty-bourgeois and aristocratic working-class character, will probably denounce Hamas, claiming that they do not support the “Islamist armies” but support the progressive side of the resistance groups. Unfortunately, they have forgotten that we live in the real world, a world in which one of the only resistance movements that has not capitulated is Hamas.</p><p name="ee04" id="ee04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as Lenin explained on numerous occasions, regarding the attitude that a communist should have towards a “bourgeois” or “reactionary” liberation movement:</p><p name="6c5b" id="6c5b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“All national oppression calls for resistance from the broad popular masses; and the resistance of a nationally oppressed population always tends towards national revolt. It is not uncommon (especially in Austria and Russia) to see the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations speak of national revolt, while in practice it concludes reactionary pacts with the bourgeoisie of the oppressive nation behind the back and against its own people. In such cases, the criticism of revolutionary Marxists should not be directed against the national movement, but against its degradation, its popularization, against the tendency to reduce it to a petty quarrel. “</p><p name="111a" id="111a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Palestinian national movement must never be denounced for its “reactionary” character, but precisely because its reactionary character could lead it to be an anti-national movement, but for now we choose, as the Bolsheviks did with regard to the Emir of Afghanistan or as we did, ironically, regarding the Taliban, to support Hamas for their fight in the name of national independence.</p><p name="e34d" id="e34d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because in addition to a banal war against Imperialism, we are talking about an existential war, for the existence of the Arab people, the Zionist Entity having massacred, raped, and reduced the Arab people to nothing. Palestine is the first trench of the Arab Nation, as Gaddafi called it, and its destruction will lead to the invasion of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, etc…</p><p name="ace7" id="ace7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why the PFLP, the Palestinian Marxist-Leninist and Arab nationalist resistance movement, fervently supports this force, sharing the announcement of the Kuwaiti progressive movement, a scientific socialist party:</p><p name="feca" id="feca" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Al-Abdul Rahim said that the unique, heroic and daring operation of the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip, which was launched, represents a direct response to the Zionist crimes against the holy sites and detainees, as well as the ongoing incursions into West Bank cities. , and in response to the continued siege of Gaza. This specific operation proves once again, in concrete terms, that our Palestinian Arab people have no choice. Confronting the Zionist entity is the only option of resistance and firmness, and that it is not possible in all circumstances to liquidate the Palestinian cause, no matter how much the conspirators conspire and those who surrender, and that it is no horizon for the Oslo conspiracy nor for normalization with the Zionist enemy, and that the resistance has gone beyond the stage of reaction to initiative and surprise in battle and shifting its main field into outside the besieged Gaza Strip.”</p><p name="43ab" id="43ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more complex conflict question is: does this war make sense from a strategic point of view? Hamas went on the offensive, to the applause of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories who saw it as excellent news.In this situation, the Zionist Entity will be able to use this to launch a “civil” war, in reality a war of purification, against the Arabs, going even further in the destruction of Palestine than before, having the justification of “fight against terrorism”.</p><p name="0b33" id="0b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hamas may be fail in its war of liberation, and will therefore lead the Palestinian trench to its downfall. We can also expect a Hamas victory, permitting the end of Israeli influence on the Middle East, at least keeping 1967 borders. But we must not ignore the possibility of Hamas defeat, which will send Arabs of Palestine to a dark age of humiliation.</p><p name="2e96" id="2e96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We already explained many times our visions that the end of Palestine can be an electro-shock to Arab unification, for Arabs to understand the danger of not uniting against their enemy.</p><p name="f14a" id="f14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shall the Arab Nation Triumph ! Shall the Zionist Entity die! Shall the Arabs get united!</p><p name="60df" id="60df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">7/10/2023</p></div></div></section><section name="8368" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="98e6" id="98e6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/10/07/regarding-the-arab-israeli-war-of-2023/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2023/10/07/regarding-the-arab-israeli-war-of-2023/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on October 7, 2023.</em></p></div></div></section>
