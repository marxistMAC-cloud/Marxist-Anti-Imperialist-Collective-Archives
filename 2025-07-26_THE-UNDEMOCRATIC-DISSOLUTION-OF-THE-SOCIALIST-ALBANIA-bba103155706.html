But also, other socialists countries dissolved undemocratically. One such example would be the Socialist Albania. So, why the dissolution was un-democratic and against the wishes of majority? We will take the facts that happened one by one.</p><h4 name="ba11" id="ba11" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">BEFORE THE ELECTIONS</h4><p name="28f0" id="28f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Right before the elections of 1991, many events happened, like mass immigration, economic problems, etc. But in the years preceding the elections, the workers kept rising in power, and during the 80s they became the majority of the parliament. So how could the workers lose their power in 1991?</p><p name="8eb0" id="8eb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The workers kept rising in power by the 70s and 80s, if we see the archives of the elections from 1970 to 1987, we can see that the manual labourer proletariat representatives in parliament were 48 in 1970, 37 in 1974, and in 1978 they jumped to all times high, to 94 parliamentarians out of 250. Of course, the rest were members of intelligentsia, bureaucrats, scientists, civil servants, peasants, e.t.c, but we can see that the group of the manual labouring proletariat was the biggest group of the parliament, since the intelligentsia and the civil servants and the scientists, while in the archives were all put together, in reality they dont form one solid group. In January 1982 the workers retained a majority with 95 representatives (a one seat increase). So how could the workers lose completely their power in 1991?</p><p name="e22a" id="e22a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can see the first signs of the fall in the first elections since Hoxha died. In 1987, the results were a sign of workers losing their parliamentary power. From 95 that they were in 1982, in 1987 they shrank to 79, seeing an increase of the petty bourgeoisie peasants from 47 in 1978, to 73 in 1982, and to 75 in 1987. [1] But lets move to the 91 elections. Some information on the 91 elections comes from US counter-revolutionary agents like the organization called National Republican institute for International affairs, which published a small book on the Albanian 1991 elections, called ‘The 1991 Elections in Albania’. [2] Important information is provided from this book. The book, explains what the trade unions of Albania did during the starting of the bourgeoisie counter-revolution of 1990. According to the Americans, they supported the government.</p><p name="bcf0" id="bcf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The official Trade Union declared its independence from the Party of Labor on 24 December 1990 and claimed it would support higher wages and better working conditions for the employees of state-owned enterprises, as well as a shortening of the work week from six days to five. But on the same day as the Trade Union’s declaration of independence, the organization issued a statement supporting the government’s crackdown on rioters throughout the country.</p><p name="d4f4" id="d4f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The agents reported in this book that before the elections they travelled across the country, and met up with both party people (who later magically turned counterrevolutionary) and Democratic Party leaders (the bourgeoisie party that led counterrevolutionaries).</p><h4 name="b1e1" id="b1e1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">THE ELECTIONS</h4><p name="8761" id="8761" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The first multiparty elections in Albania took place in 7 to 14 April 1991. So, what happened during these elections ? The Capitalist opposition, received illegal founding from USA and probably, other western states. The US noticeably supported the Democratic Party, which the ruling PLA criticized to its own advantage. Democratic Party politician visited the United States that and they reportedly were promised a «blank check» from the American Government upon coming to power, which would have entailed admission to such organizations as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. [3]</p><p name="2436" id="2436" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">David Swartz, the head of the State Department delegation sent to re-open the U.S. embassy in Tirana, said that the United States would provide Albania with desperately needed humanitarian assistance but that economic aid would be granted only if democratic forces came to power. [4]</p><p name="348d" id="348d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This aided in propaganda for opposition forces, as they passed the notion that if they would not come to power, Albania would be left in ruins without international aid. So we can see, that during these elections, opposition parties received foreign support, and even money from NED(National endowment for democracy), such as $103,000 to the dissident labor movement backing the Democratic Party. [5]</p><p name="467b" id="467b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the above papers, we can see that the bourgeoisie only had more support than the workers in the place they could propagate mostly, which was in Tirana, Shkoder(which was historically anti communist) and Durrës. But, to the surprise of the west and the capitalists, the Communists won the elections. immediately, the opposition leaders, attacked the communist party saying that they rigged the elections, despite, they themselves, having illegally received founds from foreign entities. During these elections, the communist party won with 56,2%. But what happened afterwards? The revisionist Ramiz Alia, without any reason, and having the obvious support of the people, dissolved the party, which allowed the western backed coup to solidify its position. But, some people may ask, why he could do that? Well, the good ol’ americans come again in the table, as their puppets were defeated. They approached people from the communist party, offering them money to support the opposition. It is highly possible that they bribed Alia and some other high party members to dissolve the party, which could mean that in</p><p name="bc50" id="bc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the next elections, they could not partake and exercise the power they were given by the Albanian people. Before the overthrow, some party traitors (the intelligentsia of the party such as Ismail Kadare) sided with the bourgeoisie denouncing class struggle calling it the worst warfare in the history of Albania. These people had the support of the workers and peasants, but decided to become the next bourgeoisie and to secure paychecks by US. These people opened the doors, as they left the people without a vanguard party.</p><p name="4750" id="4750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Immediately after the counter-revolution which was also aided from within the party’s bourgeoisie supporters, the communists were round up and in send to prison. [6]</p><p name="7971" id="7971" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the history continues. In 1997, after the pyramid scandal, the elections were won by the successor of the Labour party, the socialist party. This reflects that the people wanted again the left in power. Note that the communist party was still illegal.</p><p name="c9b7" id="c9b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The communist party was unbanned only in 1998, after the bourgeoisie had already consolidated their power. And today, it is estimated that half of Albanians view the socialist past as as positive. [7]</p><p name="8305" id="8305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lets hope that soon, the vanguard is fully formed in Albania and brings the proletariat in power again!</p><p name="3069" id="3069" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F.
