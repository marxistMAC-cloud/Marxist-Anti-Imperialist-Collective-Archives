An even greater victory than 2006, because, despite everything thrown at Hezbollah (the terrorist pagers explosions, Mossad infiltration, the Assassination of the entirety of the leadership, including Nasrallah, eternal leader of the Shia Arab salvation, “the linchpin of the axis”, to quote Netanyahu, killings of children, kidnappings, destruction of houses, and bombings amounting to 10 times Hiroshima), it managed to bounce back, supported by communists, Arab nationalists/socialists, Syrian social-nationalists, and destroy Jewish pride. Lebaneses must be wary, it seems the internal politics, with traitors from Lebanese forces unwilling to admit their lost bet, are ready to transform the crimes of Zionism into arguments against resistance, with people like the Western-led terrorist Geagea even saying “we are happy for the dead Lebaneses, more death means more a political loss for Hezbollah” ! Lebanese political sphere even accuses Hezbollah of all the economic problems, as if the Lebanese economic system was created by Resistance, as if the Ponzi system leading to 2019 downfall was an Iranian play, not an American-French one and linked to an ultra-liberal economy, with the private health/education systems destroying people’s lives and the dissolution of any nation-state by the communitarian interests of religious bourgeoisies. The greatest lie of these people is to pretend very seriously that Hezbollah “dragged Lebanon into a war over Gaza” while this is precisely the fact the Shia-Islamic militia didn’t want to drag Lebanon into a total war that led to such heavy hits.</p><p name="a7a9" id="a7a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding Gaza, Hamas, after the Al-Aqsa flood battle, the destruction of entire towns, the killing in battle of all their serious commanders, including Yahya Sinwar, “the father of the Arab nation”, to quote a Hebrew media, managed to strike back, backed by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Islamic Jihad, and humiliate the Zionists on the battlefield, despite the most brutal blocus in the history of humanity. Israel, which pretended to destroy Hamas and deport all Gazans to Egypt, is now kneeling down before the “Forces of Darkness” to quote their leaders. Israelis will now withdraw from Gaza, like the rats they always were, even before their northern settlers come back.</p><p name="e623" id="e623" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We must be careful, because behind this victory, lies a possible war against either Yemen or Iran, particularly since the fall of Assad. We will, despite all of our criticism against them, particularly Iran for its lack of actions against American interests in the region due to its economic crisis and will to open up the economy to European markets in hope of using its oil revenues for substantial investments in a state-led way (we must note that Islamic Revolution, as the first post-modern one, tried to be a remake of import-substitution third-world socialism without the ideological commitment to socialism, which led, like all of these instances during the 90s, to liberalization and submission to the global market), support all of these countries in a possible war against America.</p><p name="6e76" id="6e76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We must say to Arabs : see what Lebanese and Gazan armed groups, which represent less than 2% of their respective populations, were able to do. Imagine what can you do with a mass party, able to represent the will of the people ( reminder that the reason national bourgeoisie in imperialized weaker states always tries to use a form of socialism is because in our current stage, socialism is a way to integrate the proletarian and peasant masses into the national interests). Communists and real Nationalists will always triumph, against the neoliberalism from both Lebanon and Iran and mystic nationalism that led Hamas into a submission to Turkey.</p><p name="28ba" id="28ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">May the Resistance triumph!</p><p name="fddb" id="fddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">17/01/25</p></div></div></section><section name="7bb1" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="2ba8" id="2ba8" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/01/18/mac-announcement-regarding-the-situation-in-the-middle-east/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/01/18/mac-announcement-regarding-the-situation-in-the-middle-east/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on January 18, 2025.</em></p></div></div></section>
