The Zionist occupiers after years of having raped, in literally every sense of the word, the trench of the Arab Nation, Gaza, and launching an assault against the south after having asked the people of the north to flee there to escape the bombings (add another war crime to the long list!), managed to “strategically retreat”. The resistance from the Arab nationalists, such as islamists, communists, national-socialist, etc.. is an example for all humanity. This is proof that the people’s struggle, even against the most well-funded and well-equipped armies, can triumph, if it fights for social and national progress. But we must still be on guard : these forces can retreat to better attack in yet more violent ways. The false nation of “Israel” is clearly willing and able to impose its dominion over the rest of the world</p><p name="6f49" id="6f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems that this victory in Gaza inspired Iran and Hezbollah to finally respond to these Zionist crimes as their brothers in Yemen have been. But we are afraid that the war to them is merely symbolic. Will Israel and America try to counterattack and destroy the Islamic Republic? Biden refuses to attack the Persians, but we know of Zionist treachery and how little value their word holds… . The Zionist Jews already announced a possible retaliation against the Persians, against which the Persians will respond, which may well result in a world war.</p><p name="e616" id="e616" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The lack of seriousness of the Shiite movement, with the sole exception of Yemenites, must be acknowledged. And it must be seen as a immutable proof that the bourgeoisie is unable to unite the nation, that the only class able to complete this fundamental task is the only one capable of nationalism: the proletariat as only the proletariat is able to create and sustain the mode of production and achieve self-reliance.</p><p name="7aa9" id="7aa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Shiites should have fought the Zionist occupiers from the very beginning, at the very moment it became apparent that the Zionist entity would attack Gaza. In a context when the war on Ukraine is finished, these attacks without seriousness are dangerous and very well could lead to global war in the Middle East, with Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria becoming battlegrounds to be razedby the Zionists. If the war in Middle East is only between Iran and Israel, we will be forced by our anti-Zionist policy, to support Iran and to make everything in our power to disrupt the Zionist Entity and avoid the catasrophic possibility of the colonization and balkanization of Arab countries. But if the war degenerates into a world war between the both imperialist camps, we must support inter-nationalism and global self-determination. The genocidal intent of capitalism, imperialism and Zionism is more palpable than ever and we must use all the means at our disposal to fight these dangers.</p><figure name="7e40" id="7e40" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*wMLk2uNc16bgwg9w" data-width="1" data-height="1" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wMLk2uNc16bgwg9w"></figure></div></div></section><section name="d680" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="ab48" id="ab48" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/04/16/announcement-regarding-recent-developments-in-the-middle-east/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/04/16/announcement-regarding-recent-developments-in-the-middle-east/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on April 16, 2024.</em></p></div></div></section>
