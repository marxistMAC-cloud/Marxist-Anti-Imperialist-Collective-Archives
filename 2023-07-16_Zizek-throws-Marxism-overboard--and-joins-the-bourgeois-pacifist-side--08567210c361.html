With the most Eurocentric thesis we can find, having for example declared at an interview for the CIA front organization, called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Radio Free</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Europe</em> :</p><blockquote name="c240" id="c240" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">We should never forget — although I am against any racist Eurocentrism — that Europe is something unique today. And I’m saying this as a leftist, my God! </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">A vision of a corporation of states in a global emergency situation based on basic social democratic values, even if there are conservatives in power, global health care, solidarity, free education, and so on. </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">That’s why, did you notice how Europe annoys everybody today? From Latin American leftists to the American right, to Russians, to third-world fake anti-colonizers and so on….</em></blockquote><p name="5818" id="5818" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But we found an even more fascinating work from him, where Zizek officially abandoned Marxism, with a lot of determination and pride, in an article titled “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The left must embrace law and order</em>” published the fourth of July 2023.</p><blockquote name="0b3e" id="0b3e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Public protests and uprisings can play a positive role if they are sustained by an </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">emancipatory vision, such as the 2013–14 Maidan uprising in Ukraine and the ongoing Iranian protests triggered by Kurdish women who have refused to wear the burka</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">. Even the threat of violent action is sometimes necessary for political resolution. Two historic victories canonised by the liberal commentariat — the rise to power of the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa and the US civil rights protests led by Martin Luther King Jr — were only possible because they were backed by the prospect of violence by the radical wing of the ANC and more militant black Americans.</em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> The negotiations over ending apartheid in South Africa and abolishing racial segregation in the US ­succeeded because of these threats</em></strong></blockquote><p name="f596" id="f596" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Zizek coincidentally shows a lot of his admiration and love for the protests in Iran and Ukraine, which have the only common ground of being protests of the petites-bourgeoisies and proletariat, hoping to join the Imperial Camp by putting in place a comprador regime, and the parasitic working class through funds and emigration. We notice a love for the Black calm protests, without any support for the actual revolutionary movement. For Zizek, the “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">radical</em>” movement is simply a mean, a way to strengthen the only right position according to him, the integrationist movement.</p><p name="7ec0" id="7ec0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also believes very seriously that Martin Luther King was just a common democrat, that his only goal was just to fight the dirty racists and get some money from the government, that it was the only political horizon of Martin’s message, forgetting all the evolutions of Luther’s ideology. I think we will let the Marxist J.Sakai explain the matters :</p><blockquote name="3d78" id="3d78" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Poor People’s Campaign is what got Martin Luther King killed because he got out of the straight civil rights thing and said ‘ </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">we need to unite all the poor people in America, and I’m calling on everyone to come to Washington, D.C. and we’re just going to take over the D.C. Mall. We’re going to pitch tents and live there until our demands are met. We want an end to the Vietnam War, we want all these things.’</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="5264" id="5264" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">King had always very consciously had a policy, which he was public about. He fought local white Southern racists. He did not fight the federal government. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">He kept saying he wouldn’t fight the federal government. This is when he decided he had to fight the federal government, and he was proposing that all poor people unite in one movement against the government. In my opinion, that’s why they killed him. That was too much. He was supposed to be the safe alternative to Malcolm X, but he was turning radical himself.</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote name="770d" id="770d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Interview conducted and transcribed by Ernesto Aguilar, Thursday, 16 September 2004.</em></blockquote><p name="1b9b" id="1b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Zizek, after having failed in all matters, starts to dig even deeper!</p><blockquote name="a55d" id="a55d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Yet this is not the situation in France today, where violent rebellion is unlikely to end with any kind of progressive settlement for the wretched of the Earth. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">If law and order are not promptly restored, the final outcome may well be the election of Marine le Pen, the leader of the hard-right National Rally party, as the new president. The anti-immigrant nationalists are in power in Sweden, Norway and Italy — why not in France?</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> Macron has presented himself as a technocrat with no firm political stance. But a position that was once seen as a strength now looks like a fatal weakness. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In Russia, it was difficult to miss the comic nature of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">. It was over within 36 hours after the Kremlin offered him a deal. Prigozhin has avoided a legal trial but has been forced to withdraw his mercenaries from Ukraine and move to Belarus. We don’t know enough to say what really happened: was his march meant as a full-scale attack to occupy Moscow, or was it an empty threat, a gesture not meant to be realised, as Prigozhin himself has suggested? The entire episode may also have been a brute form of business negotiation — an attempt to prevent the passing of a law which stipulated that irregular forces such as the Wagner Group had to fall under the command of the regular armed forces.</em></blockquote><p name="6538" id="6538" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We notice two interesting things : (1) the possible consequece of these riots which scares our great <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Marxist”</em> intelectual the most is the fact that “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nationalists</em>” will take power, he believes that the burning hospitald and police stations care about the “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nationalist danger</em> “ . (2) this incompetent is able to compare these riots to Wagner rebellion, a pretty laughable comparison that I wouldn’t ever dare to analyze.</p><blockquote name="10f2" id="10f2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The events in France and Russia are part of a trend in Europe towards instability,crisis and disorder.</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> Today, failed states are not only in the Global South, from Somalia to Pakistan to South Africa. If we measure a failed state by the crack-up of state power, as well as the heightened atmosphere of ideological civil war, deadlocked assemblies and the growing insecurity of public spaces, then Russia, France, the UK and even the US should also be understood in similar terms.</em></blockquote><p name="7db0" id="7db0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It seems our so-called “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Marxist</em> “ Zizek is scared about instability, disorder, in short the nature of a revolution. Zizek essentially asks Western people for compassion and respect… I think comrade Marx already responded to these kinds of people :</p><blockquote name="fdd5" id="fdd5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you.

Left-liberals reacted with a mix of fascination and horror.
