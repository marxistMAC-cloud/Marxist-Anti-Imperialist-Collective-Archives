It should obviously be noted that he is not an author of ours, and is of course not representative of the MAC as an organization. We announce that we are willing to collaborate with writers who do not necessarily agree with our core principles.</p><p name="3f3d" id="3f3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, in this introduction, we will notice a thing completely ignored by this reader, due to time : the fact that a Jewish question is present in China and Africa, named the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Manchu </em>and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tutsi</em> questions. Regarding the Tutsis, we can quote a historian like Jean-Pierre Chrétien who explains that these “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ethnicities”</em> cannot be distinguished by language, culture or history (as summarized by <a href="https://shs.cairn.info/revue-histoire-monde-et-cultures-religieuses-2014-2-page-119?lang=fr#re2no2" data-href="https://shs.cairn.info/revue-histoire-monde-et-cultures-religieuses-2014-2-page-119?lang=fr#re2no2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this article</a>) and that the social situation between Tutsis and Hutus can be compared to</p><blockquote name="790d" id="790d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Authors spoke of “castes” in the 1950s, of “classes” in the 1960s. If comparisons can help, it would rather be ranks or orders, </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">states (Stände in German) in the sense of the medieval social imagination (to the point of seeing families change category when they changed social position)</em></strong></blockquote><p name="245b" id="245b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In short, the division between Tutsis and Hutus is an opposition between a fake identity around a privileged strata, against Hutus who saw themselves as a legitimate nation against colonialism.</p><p name="d56f" id="d56f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is even more interesting is when we learn historians such as Bernard Lugan, explaining that this privileged status already existed inside of Rwanda before German colonization, colonizers essentially having seen in this identity a way to have a comprador class and local bureaucracy (the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“whitests of Africa”</em>) and Hutus seems to have been inspired into revolution by Catholic missionaries, a well-known stage for many subjugated nations.</p><p name="6f6f" id="6f6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding the Manchu, a simple reading of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Revolutionary Army </em>by Zou Rong, Mao’s bedside reading, can put some light into your eyes</p><blockquote name="75ae" id="75ae" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">. To sum up, vacancies for Manchus are all greater than those for Han, in none is there any intention of equality. Opportunities for an official career for a Manchu in comparison with those for Han are hardly less far apart than clouds from mire. Hence one may often find Manchus or Han of similar grades, graduates of the same year and employed in the same office. The Han, however, may be held back for decades, without being transferred to a higher post, whereas the Manchu, in a twinkling becomes vice-president, president, subchancellor</em></blockquote><blockquote name="b67d" id="b67d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">(…)</em></blockquote><blockquote name="c86d" id="c86d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In the 260 years since the Manchu scoundrels entered the Passes, it is my fellowcountrymen’s produce they have eaten, my fellowcountrymen’s land on which they have lived. It is the complaisance and bounty of my fellowcountrymen that have penetrated their very marrow and sinews. 1f, when my fellowcountrymen urinated, the Manchus sucked off the last drops; if when they defecated, the Manchus licked off what remained, it would still be not the slightest recompence for the nurturing and benevolence with which they have favoured us. This saying does not come from my fellowcountrymen, on the contrary, it is from the lips of the Manchus.</em></blockquote><p name="e852" id="e852" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is only when a revolt against the Manchus of our times will happen, with competition abolished and national community calculating and planning what it needs to produce according to the cultural and material needs of the people, that all of these identities will be mechanically destroyed, that the mission the bourgeoisie pretended to achieve (with the 1789 French Revolution declaring the national community as the only legitimate one, or the actions of the imperialist Germany) will be finally realized by the proletariat !</p><p name="7613" id="7613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As one of our writers, Kuqe, <a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/why-is-the-1856-article-by-marx-the-russian-loan-being-cencored/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/why-is-the-1856-article-by-marx-the-russian-loan-being-cencored/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a>, the Liberation War of the World’s Goyim has started!</p><p name="7424" id="7424" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">G. Jadid.</p><p name="a5c1" id="a5c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Describing himself as “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Undefeated Tankie Warlord</em> “, Haz Al Din’s more recent claims on the Jewish Question are similarly outrageous. He claims that only the Western civilization had a Jewish Question; thus, he manages the remarkable feat of not only managing to ignore the elephant in the room, but makes the entire herd invisible. Then he points to the wars in medieval Europe, stating that Jews were only tolerated as whipping boys to assuage European anger in European civilization’s collective failure. For someone who claims to uphold Marxism and materialism, this is antithetical to what Haz claims to be, as he decides to play the emotional card rather than pointing out the financial roles Jews had in Europe. After bashing Europe for a few more paragraphs, he has the audacity to claim that the other civilizations were a stark contrast to Western civilization in that they expanded and united and sought greatness. He further heaps lavish praise on such empires, ignoring the foundations of how these empires expanded and remained in statehood: violence, oppression, and brute force.</p><p name="ea6e" id="ea6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Haz claims</p><blockquote name="5bed" id="5bed" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">‘There was never a “Jewish question” in Islamic, Chinese or other Eurasian civilizations.</em></blockquote><p name="7c82" id="7c82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">However, we can flip this statement to find that the opposite is true. Jews in antiquity were expelled across Babylonia; The Persians banned the Sabbath and killed off half the Jewish population in the latter half of the 400s, Arab Islamic empires expelled Jews numerous times in the 600s and beyond; The Chinese in Canton expelled Jews in the 800s, and so on to the present day where the indigenous people in Palestine attempt to evict swathes of illegal Jewish settlers. Considering Haz’s own background, he certainly knows of specific examples, such as the massacre of Jews of the Jewish tribe, Banu Quraiza. Historians differ whether Banu Quraiza had a formal treaty with the Arab Muslims or if they were merely neutral. Regardless, they turned to ally with the Arab Pagans when the Arab Muslims were besieged, but it was an alliance that failed to bear them fruit. The Arab Pagans were repelled. Banu Quraiza, left without local allies, were defeated. Perhaps due to political matters, a former Jew converted to Islam from a formerly Jewish tribe was chosen to cast judgment, Sa’d bin Mu’adh. We find that his judgment was according to Jewish religious law:</p><blockquote name="4894" id="4894" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">When the Lord thy God hath delivered it unto thy hands, thou shalt smite every male therein with the edge of the sword: but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself. (Deuteronomy 20: 12. )</em></blockquote><p name="85af" id="85af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">All pubescent males were executed, several hundred in total. This is in addition to the various wars with other Jewish tribes in the region, although none were treated as severely. Thus we see Haz’s intellectual dishonesty; dishonesty and not ignorance, as he is sure to know of these events considering how well read he claims to be.</p><p name="c5bc" id="c5bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In his next claim, Haz tries mixing truth with lie:</p><blockquote name="42f8" id="42f8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">As much as JQers point out the history of Jewish expulsions, they neglect how odd it was that Jews, were even tolerated as a religious minority in the first place — when almost no other religious group was.</em></blockquote><p name="b365" id="b365" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It is true that medieval Europe was generally intolerant of other ideological minorities. However, he comes to the following erroneous conclusion:</p><blockquote name="149f" id="149f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The answer to this question is obvious: Jews were kept around in Western Europe as a punching bag, to act as a scapegoat for the defects and shortcomings of what was indisputably a dysfunctional civilization.</em></blockquote><p name="7e98" id="7e98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Regardless of the failings of medieval Europe, there is no evidence they kept Jews as scapegoats. Why were they expelled then? It would defeat the purpose of having Jews to begin with. Were the expulsions arbitrary and random? No, the Jews were kept because the Jews were apparently similar to others in the nation, nor did they pose immediate threat. It was only until their Jewishness became too evident and detrimental that they were expelled. This begs the question, what is a Jew?</p><p name="0744" id="0744" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be a Jew is to have a non-identity as a primary identity. A religious and observant Jew is as Jewish as a secular, liberal, rainbow flag-waving Jew. A Russian Jew is as Jewish as an Arab Jew. The Jew is not a semite either, despite their claims of being so; the vast majority are descended from converts. And even in the instances that a Jew may find some traces of semitic DNA, it is akin to a white man claiming Africanhood from an ancient ancestor who passed on 1% black DNA. In spite of these differences of race, language, traditionalism, religiosity, etc, the Jew puts the Jew before his other identities. Thus a more accurate terminology is as such: Jewish Russian, Jewish liberal, etc. with the more pragmatic implication that the Jew/non-identity places its raison d’être before its secondary identity. This primary identity may or may not conform with its interests to its secondary identity; however, as it eventually inevitably diverges as Jews accumulate greater wealth and power, so too do the interests of the Jews diverge from the interests of the nation to which it belongs, due to its inherent capitalist nature. This is why Jews are disproportionately in the cosmopolitan bourgeois class relative to their population. This is also where most of the typical so called anti-Semetic tropes are derived from. This dynamic also explains the variety of points the Jew defenders often bring up; if Jews only care about their own, then why are there poor Jews? What about the rich people who aren’t Jews? Why were Jews not a problem until they were suddenly expelled?</p><blockquote name="9a51" id="9a51" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Compare this to the grand, sublime land empires of Eurasia or even Meso-America. Whose development tended in the direction of territorial expansion, unity, and historical greatness. Where the individual interest was fully subordinated to the reality of a greater whole</em></blockquote><p name="8a6e" id="8a6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Haz’s quotation comes into contrast with his previous claims of anti imperialism, although that is not the point of this article. It’s worth mentioning, however, that territorial expansion and unity can be measured by power and force. By those metrics, we should label the British Empire as the grandest and most sublime of all empires, or the Mongol Empire, or some other brutal expansionist power that expanded with violence and kept its empire united by viciousness. Better measures would be fair rule of law, minimization of initiations of rebellions, wealth distribution, etc. But as far as the JQ is concerned, we find that the Jewish expulsions in Spain on 1492 coincided with the Spanish Golden Age. Perhaps Haz would reconsider the meaning of greatness and the means to achieve it.</p><p name="56de" id="56de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a few more paragraphs attacking the West based on the faulty premises before, Haz approaches his conclusion to say:</p><blockquote name="575e" id="575e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Herzl, founder of Zionism said — “The anti-semites shall be our best allies.” Both Zionists and Jew-tweakers have a sick pathological mutual relationship going on.’</em></blockquote><p name="60ba" id="60ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">There is a push and pull dynamic in this statement. The anti semites wanted to “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">push</em>” Jews out, and the Zionists wanted to be “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pulled</em> “ together. United in their goals, they wanted to found a state for Jews, as they thought the Jews constituted a nation. By that measure, a Chinese Jew and an Ethiopian Jew and a Spanish Jew would all be one and the same. The Havaara Agreement was made by Nazis and Zionist German Jews to send Jews to Palestine in the 30s, both thinking that Germans and Jews could not co exist because they were different nations. In contrast, the Association of German National Jews, an organization made by a Jew to integrate Jews into Nationalist Germany and to eradicate their Jewishness, was disbanded by the Nazis because they thought Jews were a wholly disparate people.</p><p name="fddc" id="fddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In conclusion, the Jewish Question is relevant to the masses around the world, not a phenomenon limited to the West. Anti semitism is bred from the behavior of Jews, a behavior which emerges from the non-identity of Jewishness. To answer the Jewish Question with the Jewish Answer is to liberate nations from Jews, as well as to liberate Jews from themselves from the recurrent misery that has plagued them through millenia.</p><p name="bcfd" id="bcfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">-zazoorz</p><p name="6e7c" id="6e7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">11/09/24</p></div></div></section><section name="b70c" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c027" id="c027" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/09/12/some-notes-regarding-the-jewish-question-from-one-of-our-reader/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/09/12/some-notes-regarding-the-jewish-question-from-one-of-our-reader/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on September 11, 2024.</em></p></div></div></section>
