From Yahoo! News:</p><blockquote name="935b" id="935b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in the Africa and the Middle East and beyond,” Biden said in prepared remarks released by the White House.</blockquote><blockquote name="59f0" id="59f0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism,” Biden added in the remarks.</blockquote><p name="562b" id="562b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Of course, by “white supremacist”, he means white nationalists.</p><p name="e43f" id="e43f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The media realizes this was too direct of an acknowledgement, and of course must play their part. They remind any white nationalists that Biden didn’t really mean to say what he did:</p><p name="cca2" id="cca2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While delivering the speech to Congress, Biden slightly departed from the prepared script, saying that “white supremacy is terrorism.”</p><p name="9136" id="9136" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He meant to say (option 1), “The most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today, white supremacy is terrorism”? This means the same thing. Or did he mean to only say (option 2) “White supremacy is terrorism”, and just added all the other stuff? In that case, we believe the authority of the President overrides the authority of his speechwriters. He said what he said, and he meant it.</p><p name="d6b7" id="d6b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The article then cites FBI Director Christopher Wray:</p><blockquote name="ff69" id="ff69" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now, and it’s not going away any time soon,” Wray said at the time. “We viewed it as such a critical threat that back in June 2019 we elevated racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism to our highest threat priority, on the same level as ISIS and homegrown violent extremists.”</blockquote><p name="444d" id="444d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It’s funny when one considers that the integrationist, cosmopolitan “Black Lives Matter” movement, the antithesis to all Black Power, the vehicle of liberalism into the minds of prospective black nationalists, would start only a year after the FBI declared its opposite – the “racial and ethnic extremist” movement – to be its highest priority.</p><p name="8af0" id="8af0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reader should note: _racial and ethnic extremism. The Director did not say “white supremacy” specifically, meaning, both white and black nationalism. The Director explains why:</p><blockquote name="c19d" id="c19d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“One of the things we struggle with in particular is that more and more, the ideologies, if you will, that are motivating these violent extremists are less and less coherent, less and less linear, less and less easy to pin down,” Wray said. “In some cases it seems like people coming up with their own customized belief system – a little bit of this, a little bit of that – and they put it together, maybe combined with some personal grievance that’s happened to them in their lives, and that drives them.”</blockquote><p name="8537" id="8537" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What is “incoherent” to the Director is clear as glass to us: the most advanced elements of various nations have been starting to find common ground in their opposition to the American state. What the Director talks of so fearfully here is the prospect of various nationalists realizing they might not have that much to gain from standing against one another, and might have everything to gain from standing against the American State and their Federal Bureau.</p><p name="5451" id="5451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ll take another look. From USA Today:</p><blockquote name="e92a" id="e92a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In discussing his order to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan, Biden noted global terror networks have largely moved beyond the country and that white supremacists posed a bigger threat than foreign actors.</blockquote><blockquote name="92bc" id="92bc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">«We won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism,” Biden cautioned</blockquote><p name="60a3" id="60a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So, this was the nature of the quote. He said option 1, which means he did indeed acknowledge white nationalism as the biggest threat.</p><p name="9b9e" id="9b9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The article then offers a brief explanation of who Biden was addressing:</p><blockquote name="cd7f" id="cd7f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Biden made his comments while speaking in House chamber, which just three months ago was infiltrated by a pro-Trump mob in an effort to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Rioters carried Confederate flags and nooses, and wore shirts saying the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust weren’t enough.</blockquote><p name="e8de" id="e8de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The terror! USA Today is so concerned for the safety of the American people, they must expose these vile racists. Let’s see how much integrity USA Today has, if they adhere to their own principles:</p><p name="87e5" id="87e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Biden made his comments while speaking in House chamber, which just three months ago was infiltrated by a pro-Trump mob in an effort to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.</p><p name="3769" id="3769" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Overthrow” is definitely an amusing term. Clearly, USA Today believes that Biden is the legitimate winner of the election, and that something like 80 million Americans are wrong for believing otherwise. Surely, this is out of the principle of objective journalism?</p><p name="6b50" id="6b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Saying “this is not something we do lightly or do eagerly”, USA Today has made its first ever presidential endorsement – of Joe Biden.</p><p name="bd6c" id="bd6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2016, the widely read paper, which was founded in 1982, urged readers not to vote for Donald Trump. But it did not endorse Hillary Clinton.</p><p name="b93e" id="b93e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, perhaps not so objective. USA Today has some vested interests, and whatever these interests are, it leads them to formally oppose Donald Trump. And now, they write an article about how the people who stormed the Capitol on behalf of Trump are all racists, Nazis, etc.</p><p name="aa8a" id="aa8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next claim:</p><blockquote name="8fa0" id="8fa0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Rioters carried Confederate flags…</blockquote><p name="e129" id="e129" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is true. First, we will say this: we frankly don’t care what one does in their personal time. But we should say, it does seem like USA Today is not a very good source to be determining who is and is not a “racist”, considering just two years ago, their editor launched a campaign to “expose” (ruin the careers of) people who wore blackface[4] in their highschool yearbook photos. The end result was the discovery of the editor’s own _blackface photo, in her highschool yearbook[5]. The photo is complete with dreadlocks and field labor, the quintessential pieces of any good slave dress-up. It should go without saying that the editor still works there.</p><p name="d7f3" id="d7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And second: who cares? It is a Confederate flag. It’s less offensive than the American one which hangs in the Capitol all the time. The flag is said to represent slavery. We won’t dispute this in full, only partially: it does not represent slavery, but rather, a nation of slavers, who rose up and gave their lives fighting a country of genociders and nation-destroyers who were, just six decades prior, also a nation of slavers. Slavery served to be as much an economic impetuous for the Civil War as the Revolutionary War.</p><p name="b3e8" id="b3e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, the Confederacy is not around today. The USA is. We know our priorities and enemies, and it seems USA Today knows theirs.</p><p name="1b50" id="1b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…And nooses. This one is really just amusing, because it is completely dishonest on USA Today’s part. They attempt to relate the presence of nooses at the protests to the symbolism behind the lynching of African-Americans.</p><p name="c9f1" id="c9f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The noose in question was set up on a platform in front of the Capitol prior to the riot. The protestors gathered around the platform and chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!”</p><p name="efac" id="efac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether or not Mike Pence is Black, we will allow the reader to find out for themselves.</p><p name="ef72" id="ef72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And lastly:</p><blockquote name="7772" id="7772" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">…And wore shirts saying the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust weren’t enough.</blockquote><p name="6788" id="6788" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">A shirt! An offensive shirt! In the Capitol!</p><p name="9cfc" id="9cfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Someone ought to tell USA Today that this is the same Capitol which housed Congress in 1936, who were allowing American companies to actively finance the actual Nazis.</p><p name="99a6" id="99a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And all of this – the whole pearl-clutching paragraph – comes from USA Today, who formally endorsed Joe Biden. For that reason, we will rewrite their sentence for them:</p><p name="4bbf" id="4bbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Biden made his comments while speaking in House chamber, which just three months ago was infiltrated by a pro-Trump mob in an effort to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Biden is the author of the 1994 Crime Bill which saw the US prison population skyrocket to 2.2 million people, infamous for his tendency to rub his hands over young girls and sniff their hair, gave hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to Israel to encourage retaliation against the Arabs, and helped initiate the US bombing campaign on Kosovo, saying we should strike civilians “not for justice, but for release”.</p><p name="db0d" id="db0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rioters carried Confederate flags and nooses, and wore shirts saying the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust weren’t enough.</p><p name="d4e7" id="d4e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the saying goes, one can’t be neutral on a moving train. We will let the reader decide which one is worse, who we are to stand behind, and who we are to stand against. Are we siding with the ones who glorify fascism, or the ones who practice it?</p><p name="2219" id="2219" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Biden then rather abruptly switches to his most worthy Obama impersonation, offering homeopathic therapy to the dying American “nation”:</p><blockquote name="11ff" id="11ff" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">«White supremacy is terrorism, and we’re not going to ignore that either. My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation,” Biden said.</blockquote><p name="1522" id="1522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And then the article concludes with some valuable information:</p><blockquote name="f319" id="f319" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Federal law enforcement and analysts within the Department of Homeland Security warn that the threat from white supremacist organizations will remain a persistent threat in the country in the coming years.</blockquote><blockquote name="f2a5" id="f2a5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">White supremacists and other like-minded extremists conducted 67% of terrorist plots and attacks in the United States in 2020, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. It also noted anarchist, anti-fascist, and other like-minded attacks and plots comprised 20% of U.S. terrorist incidents in 2020, an increase from 8% in 2019.</blockquote><p name="5758" id="5758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It seems our “anarchist” friends, as usual, are fighting against the masses.</p><p name="c8ea" id="c8ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other than that, the conclusions draw themselves. We won’t state what doesn’t need to be stated. If one is to proclaim “Death to America!” they must be able to explain what results in the aftermath.</p><p name="90e3" id="90e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With this we say: long live the American peoples, and death to the integrationist state!</p><p name="8d70" id="8d70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">J.
