Zionists are clamoring that “anti-Semitism is on the rise.”</p><p name="b925" id="b925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What could explain this “rise in anti-Semitism”? More importantly, why is there growing hatred of Jews even throughout the West, which has been a safe haven for Jews since the mid-20th century?</p><p name="7ba8" id="7ba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answer is quite simple: the Arabs disdain the Jews for waging a war upon them and for displacing them from the Middle East. Even if this were not the case, they would disdain the Jews for the simple fact that they are infidels, and Islam disdains all infidels-especially the Jews. This fact is known to everybody, and to the Israelis in particular. If one watches an hour of television in any Arab country, he can be sure to hear condemnation of the Jews, and oftentimes even praise of Hitler.</p><p name="8919" id="8919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet the Jews and their gentile Zionist allies, both in Israel and abroad, have pushed adamantly for the importation of millions of these Muslim Arabs into Western countries, ushering in a great deal of conflict and violence. They have done this largely against the will of the native Western populations, and in fact to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">subdue </em>these native populations. They have thus simultaneously imported communities who despise them, and at the same time have aroused the hatred of the Westerners.</p><p name="49db" id="49db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may seem like a very bold claim. But the reader’s attention may be directed to a noteworthy article which recently appeared in The Washington Post, titled:</p><p name="304b" id="304b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The West Should Welcome Gaza Refugees-Europe and the U.S. accepted millions who fled earlier wars.” (1) The article explains that the conflict between Palestine and Israel is bound to create between 1 to 2 million refugees, and asserts that the West “should offer a haven” and “facilitate the relocation of Gazan refugees to countries willing to take them.” “[Western] countries can accomplish this by creating… internationally coordinated relocation programs,” and “can collaborate to provide long-term financial support” to the refugees.</p><p name="a306" id="a306" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, while Westerners increasingly struggle with affording homes and making ends meet, they should invite in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more </em>masses of foreigners and give them <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more </em>money for free (something which they have been doing for many years at this point without any conceivable benefit, and at great cost to themselves). The Israelis, who have effectively created these refugees in the first place, and who refuse a ceasefire in favor of leveling Gaza, decline to take them in. Even neighboring Arab countries have declined to accept these refugees, with Egyptian President El-Sissi declaring that there shall be “no refugees in Jordan or Egypt,” as “a mass exodus would risk bringing [in] militants.” (2) This is all good and well: it is their right. But does the West not have a similar right? What we wish to call attention to in particular are the authors of the aforementioned article: Danny Danon and Ram Ben-Barak.</p><p name="94d6" id="94d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Times of Israel has published its own article titled “Two Israeli lawmakers call on European countries to take in Gaza refugees,” which explains that both Danon and Ben-Barak are Jews who sit in Israel’s Parliament. (3) Danon is a member of the ruling Likud Party, while Ben-Barak is a member of the opposition Yesh Atid Party; Danon is also the former Israeli Ambassador to the UN, and Ben-Barak is the former Deputy Director of the Mossad.</p><p name="a558" id="a558" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Times of Israel accordingly describes their refugee scheme as “a rare display of cross-party solidarity,” and they likely had no trouble getting this scheme published in The Washington Post since its owner, Jeff Bezos, signed a $1.2 billion technology contract with the Israeli Military back in 2021. (4)</p><p name="7744" id="7744" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would seem that on one end of the spectrum, the Zionists destroy the Arab countries, creating millions of refugees who they refuse to house or care for; and on the other end, the very same Zionists pressure the Western countries to house and care for these refugees. While demonizing and dehumanizing the Arabs down to their children in the Israeli press, they fill the Western press with moralistic appeals to the Arabs’ innocence and humanity. The Westerners are themselves sure to be defamed as racists, fascists, and “white supremacists” should they oppose this scheme. No such condemnations are to be leveled upon the Egyptians and Jordanians, and obviously not upon the Israelis.</p><p name="e633" id="e633" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through these acts, the Jews earn the ire of the Westerners, who increasingly view their “greatest ally” as subversive, destructive, treacherous, and ungrateful.</p><p name="aaa4" id="aaa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, the Jews find that the imported populations, whom they intended to use as bludgeons against the Westerners, despise the Jews more than they despise any other infidel sect. We now see crowds of Arabs marching through Australia chanting: “Gas the Jews!” The media and Jewish organizations report on such events with fright, but remain conspicuously vague about the cultural background of these crowds. Even when lamenting “the recent rise of anti-Semitism,” the Jews cannot stop themselves from blaming this phenomenon almost <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">entirely </em>on the Westerners, and hesitate to say a word about its prevalence among the imported Arab communities. They treat it as yet another product of Western racism, a cousin to Western “Islamophobia”. As the article by Danon and Ben- Barak shows, the Jews continue to push Westerners to accept masses of Arabs into their countries.</p><p name="3e13" id="3e13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prominent faces of the conservative political movement-at least in the United States- are growing comfortable drawing attention to the hypocrisy of the Jews in this matter. Elon Musk recently made headlines for agreeing with the claim that “Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them,” and that “Jews are coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities… flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much.” In the same week, conservative commentators Tucker Carlson, Charlie Kirk, and Candace Owens all made similar statements. (5) The media was quick to condemn these figures as “anti- Semites,” and media conglomerates Disney, Warner Bros, and Paramount-run by the Jews Bob Iger, David Zaslav, and Brian Robbins, respectively-have withdrawn advertising from Musk’s X service. (6)</p><p name="1b59" id="1b59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such observations have been practically forbidden since the mid-20th century, but are becoming increasingly prevalent in mainstream discourse. The Jews now feel the tides turning against them. And yet the Jews remain blind to, or pretend not to see, the way in which their own actions have brought this enmity upon themselves. As with all their critics, they rabidly decry the aforementioned individuals as having fallen, without any conceivable reason, into the vice of “anti-Semitism.” Rather than understanding how their actions incite both the Arabs and the Westerners, they continue to view “anti-Semitism” as a nebulous thing which springs up from nowhere but the gentile instincts of the sons of Esau and Ishmael, as an irrational and paranoid mental illness in the same class as schizophrenia. To them, “anti-Semitism” can be summarized as simply anything which criticizes the Jews or Israel, or which does not recognize them as God’s chosen race.</p><p name="cebf" id="cebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">REFERENCES:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="bbeb" id="bbeb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Danny Danon and Ram Ben-Barak.
