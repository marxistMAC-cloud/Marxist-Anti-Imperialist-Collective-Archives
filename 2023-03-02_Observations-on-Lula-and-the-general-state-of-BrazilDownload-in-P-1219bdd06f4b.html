<section name="cfca" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3ad6" id="3ad6" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Observations on Lula and the general state of Brazil</h3><p name="d1c1" id="d1c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LULA AND BOLSANARO</strong></p><p name="2d99" id="2d99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On 1 January 2023, Luiz Inácio Lula of the Workers’ Party became the President of Brazil, replacing Jair Bolsonaro of the Liberal Party. What we intend to understand is how this election was not a choice between a pro-globalist candidate and an anti-globalist candidate either way; but an election between a puppet of American financial monopoly (i.e. Democratic Party) and a puppet of American industrial monopoly (i.e. Republican Party). We intend for this study to be useful even for non-Brazilians, because it provides insight into politics under the regime of globalism.</p><p name="c4fd" id="c4fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us obtain a brief understanding of the two candidates. Jair Bolsonaro, President from 2019–2022, presents himself as a center-right populist, leading the “Good of Brazil” coalition, which consists of the Liberal Party, Republican Party, and Progressive Party. He has pursued general market liberalization and foreign investment. He is quite fond of the USA, and in fact, since losing the election, he has moved to the USA.</p><p name="eccf" id="eccf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most Americans are familiar with Bolsonaro only through exceedingly negative articles in liberal mainstream news. The Democrats do not seem to like him at all. But he has received some praise from the Republicans: Donald Trump endorsed Bolsonaro as “one of the greatest presidents of any country in the world.”</p><p name="8b52" id="8b52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, Luiz Inácio Lula was already President of Brazil from 2003–2010, where he pursued a leftist agenda. He describes himself as a “socialist,” and got his start in the Brazilian labor union movement. In the recent election, Lula led the “Brazil of Hope” coalition, which consists of ten leftist parties, including the Workers’ Party, Socialist Party, and Communist Party.</p><p name="e9a0" id="e9a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2018, just before the 2019 election, Lula was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison for corruption, bribery, money laundering, and other charges related to his presidency in a very controversial trial. Whether he was actually corrupt or not, the reader can come to their own determination. Lula’s sentence was annulled by a judge in 2021, and within a year, he has become President.</p><p name="d63f" id="d63f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">THE ELECTION AND CAPITOL RIOT</strong></p><p name="1d70" id="1d70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The election was a very close contest: 50.9% for Lula, 49.1% for Bolsonaro, a margin of just 1.8%. The Brazilian left was of course pleased. The journalist Pepe Escobar, a self-described anti-imperialist, published an article for the Chinese paper Asia Times which gave a very flattering description of Lula and a very derisive description of “toxic Bolsonarism”. He writes:</p><blockquote name="7f16" id="7f16" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Lula may be the ultimate political comeback kid. At 77, fit and sharp, leading an alliance of 10 political parties… Lula is a master of this craft… Lula, an exceptional negotiator, won against the apparatus unleashed by Bolsonaro, which saw vote-buying, fake news, and voter suppression by rabid Bolsonarists. Toxic Bolsonarism will continue to prosper as a fake ‘anti-system.’ Bolsonaro and countless fanatic supporters flirted with Nazism, unabashedly praised known torturers during the Brazilian military dictatorship, and milked fascist leanings in Brazilian society. Bolsonarism is a military- concocted movement subservient to hardcore neoliberal globalist elites and comprised of evangelicals and agribusiness tycoons while posing as ‘anti-globalist.’ No wonder the virus contaminated literally half of a dazed and confused nation.” (1)</em></blockquote><p name="1cf7" id="1cf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Bolsonaro’s supporters, on the other hand, declared that the close election contest was rigged. We cannot really say whether it was rigged or not. We can simply comment that between foreign clandestine agencies and the globalist NGOs, it would be quite surprising if the election wasn’t rigged (and the same thing would have been true if Bolsonaro were elected). After all, we are speaking of Brazil. Bolsonaro himself once admitted:</p><p name="2564" id="2564" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’ll never change anything in this country through voting-absolutely nothing.”</p><p name="4591" id="4591" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is worth noting that Reuters reported in May of 2022 that CIA Director William Burns visited Brazil and “told Brazilian officials that Bolsonaro should stop casting doubt on his country’s voting system ahead of the election,” and that “elections are not an issue to be messed with.” (2) This should speak for itself: if a Brazilian intelligence agent went to the US and delivered such a message, it would immediately cast doubt on the legitimacy of the American elections.</p><p name="c008" id="c008" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Lula really stood against the globalization of Brazil, would the globalist bourgeoisie and its appendages- CIA, etc.-really let him to be simply voted into power?</p><p name="0a1b" id="0a1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In protest of the supposedly rigged election, supporters of Bolsonaro rioted and broke into the Brazilian Capitol, reminiscent one of the incident with Trump’s supporters in the US a couple years ago. The reprisals against the rioters have been quite harsh. Several were arrested by the military, including Bolsonaro’s Minister of Justice and Public Security, Anderson Torres, who was arrested on the orders of Judge Alexandre de Moraes, a member of the Social Democratic Party (3) (4). President Lula naturally declared his support of these actions:</p><blockquote name="f4be" id="f4be" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The coup plotters in Brasilia are being identified and will be punished. Tomorrow we resume work. Democracy always. Goodnight.” (5)</em></blockquote><p name="45bd" id="45bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It is worth observing that, much like Trump, Bolsonaro responded to the capitol protests by disavowing his own supporters and leaving them to their fate. He then went back to posting videos of himself playing PlayStation Virtual Reality games from his residence in the US. Lula’s Government has nonetheless frozen Bolsonaro’s assets, revoked his diplomatic immunity, and plans to take action against him if he returns to Brazil.</p><figure name="b66d" id="b66d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*-wWqqW62qCPX0mT7" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-wWqqW62qCPX0mT7"></figure><p name="2da9" id="2da9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It is interesting to note that Escobar characterizes Bolsonaro’s supporters as being genuinely “anti- globalist” and “anti-system,” and insists they are simply misled into supporting Bolsonaro. If this is true, it forces us to consider the following: when Bolsonaro renounced his own side, a mass of “anti-globalist,” “anti- system” elements was left without a leader.</p><p name="f298" id="f298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet the “communists,” as well as the various “socialist” and “social-democratic” parties, and leftist journalists like Escobar-who all like to proclaim themselves as the saviors of the Brazilian masses from global profiteers-have not assumed leadership of this leaderless movement; have not taken it upon themselves to organize and direct this movement, to educate the movement and raise the general level of awareness about the forces in control of Brazil. Far from it: they have unswervingly supported Lula and the state, and have positioned themselves <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">against </em>the masses and<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> in favor</em> of the military and its reprisals-all while Escobar makes the accusation that “Bolsonarism is a military-concocted movement.”</p><p name="bc50" id="bc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LULA’S ADMIRERS</strong></p><p name="33ca" id="33ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Americans are quite involved in Brazilian politics. We mentioned how Bolsonaro received support from global industry, while Lula, on the other hand, has received considerable support from global finance. It is worth noting that in 2007, Lula was apparently endorsed to some degree by the International Monetary Fund:</p><blockquote name="eb50" id="eb50" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The likelihood that Lula might win the election caused substantial capital outflows and worries that existing market-friendly economic policies could be overturned… But Lula’s government pursued policies that were prudent and courageous, using fiscal discipline.” (6)</em></blockquote><p name="2fd1" id="2fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This “fiscal discipline” was exemplified recently, when Lula “reiterated promises to abandon the country’s constitutionally mandated cap on public spending, which he called a ‘stupidity.’” (7)</p><p name="0bd5" id="0bd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the recent election, Jacobin-an American leftist paper known for consistently backing CIA coups (Grayzone, a rival American leftist paper, writes: “Jacobin’s ‘Socialism Conference’ features government-funded activists… including two speakers bankrolled by the CIA’s National Endowment for Democracy… Jacobin founder Sunkara spoke alongside [liberal elite] Naomi Klein of Rutgers University… Under the slogan ‘no bosses, no borders’… the conference calls for radical economic transformation of foreign governments.” (97))-published an article which stated that “Lula is giving a lesson in how to respond to right-wing attacks 1 on democracy,” “swiftly cracking down on the perpetrators,” who are described as “a rabid crowd in green and yellow.” (5)</p><p name="1eba" id="1eba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has written two different articles in praise of Lula for Jacobin . The first supported Lula’s election campaign: Corbyn stated that “Lula’s victory is a testament to solidarity,” that Lula seeks to “defeat fascism, secure social justice, and save the future of our planet.” (8) The second article supported Lula’s reprisals against the protestors: Corbyn wrote that “Brazil’s insurrection plotters are trying to destroy democracy,” and that “those who understand the significance of Lula’s victory know what’s at stake.” (9)</p><p name="14f6" id="14f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In between the publication of these articles, Corbyn also published an article for The Independent, claiming that “Lula’s triumph in Brazil proves that when we are united, transformative change can be won.” (10)</p><p name="62ed" id="62ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a notorious Senator for the US Democratic Party, has also issued her praise for Lula, stating that “we must stand in solidarity with Lula’s democratically elected government.” She referred to the Capitol rioters as “fascists,” comparing them to the “fascists who attacked the US Capitol two years ago.” She further demanded that “the US must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro.” (11)</p><p name="a3aa" id="a3aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cortez was not the only Democratic Party Senator to praise Lula; there was also Bernie Sanders. When Lula was convicted in 2018, Sanders went to the Brazilian Embassy and “delivered a letter signed by 29 US politicians demanding the release of the former president.” (12) When Lula was released, Sanders stated that he was “delighted that Lula has been released from jail, something that never should have happened in the first place.” (13) Sanders also said Bolsonaro was part of “a global movement toward oligarchy, xenophobia, and authoritarianism,” alongside leaders like “Putin, Xi, Duterte, and Orbán.” (14)</p><p name="5b94" id="5b94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Corbyn, Cortez, and Sanders all describe themselves as “socialists,” similar to Lula. But support for Lula has not been characteristic of the “socialists” alone. Even the centrist liberals of the US have praised him. The Brookings Institution-one of the leading liberal think- tanks-declared Lula’s election to be “a victory for democracy,” assuring that “Lula is a pragmatist” and that “the ‘communist’ Lula has been greatly exaggerated over the years.” (15)</p><p name="81e4" id="81e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Above all else, Lula seems to have a great reputation with the US President Joe Biden, who came into power under very similar conditions. In 2021, Lula referred to Joe Biden “a breath for democracy in the world”. (16) Ryan Cooper of The American Prospect tells us that ultimately, “Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders helped Lula win,” and “if Joe Biden had not won the U.S. election in 2020, it’s highly likely that Lula would not have been able to claim victory.” (17) He points to Biden’s CIA Director Burns as evidence.</p><p name="13a1" id="13a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Lula was elected, he received a congratulatory call from Biden. This call went past mere formalities. The following comes directly from the White House:</p><blockquote name="8e95" id="8e95" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“President Biden and President Lula spoke by telephone this afternoon. Biden conveyed the US’s unwavering support for the will of the Brazilian people as expressed in the recent election, which Lula won. Biden condemned the attack on democratic institutions and on the peaceful transfer of power. The two leaders pledged to work closely together on the issues confronting the US and Brazil, including climate change, economic development, and peace and security. Biden invited Lula to visit Washington in early February for in-depth consultations on a shared agenda, and President Lula accepted the invitation.” (18)</em></blockquote><p name="765c" id="765c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So the Brazilian President will be visiting the White House for “in-depth consultations on a shared agenda.” Escobar, for some reason desperate to preserve Lula’s reputation, writes that “Lula will visit Washington because he has to-keep your friends close and your enemies closer.” But one would think that sharing your enemy’s agenda is perhaps <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too </em>close.</p><p name="e65a" id="e65a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only does this look bad for Joe Biden, because he has a shared agenda with somebody who is endorsed by the Communist Party; it also looks bad for the Communist Party, because they are endorsing somebody who has a shared agenda with Joe Biden.</p><p name="441e" id="441e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LULA’S CABINET</strong></p><p name="44db" id="44db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Escobar has talked quite a bit about how Bolsonaro is an agent of globalism, and seems to consistently imply that Lula is the opposite. But rather strangely, he at one point acknowledges the following:</p><blockquote name="28c2" id="28c2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The international financial system and Washington DC, who already control Bolsonaro’s agenda, have captured Lula’s administration before it has even begun. This may suggest an incoming, shady pseudo-Left government by the Workers Party-neoliberalism with a human face-essentially serving the interests of Wall Street and the Democrat-controlled State Department.” (1)</em></blockquote><p name="30f3" id="30f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let us look more directly at some of these individuals who have found their way into Lula’s cabinet. Escobar writes:</p><blockquote name="0f69" id="0f69" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Much will depend on who Lula appoints as his finance minister. The top candidate is Henrique Meirelles, former CEO of FleetBoston, Brazil’s second largest external creditor after CitiGroup. Meirelles has expressed unrestricted support for Lula, for whom he previously worked as central bank chief. Meirelles is likely to prescribe the exact same economic policies as Bolsonaro’s top economic enforcer, banker Paulo Guedes.” (Ibid).</em></blockquote><p name="4cf3" id="4cf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The socialist apparently has “the exact same economic policies” as the liberal. It feels worth observing that Meirelles was hired by the Chinese cryptocurrency company Binance in September of 2022, just before Lula’s election. (19)</p><p name="8f70" id="8f70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another potential cabinet pick is Pedro Abramovay, a Jewish lawyer who, as it happens, is the Executive Director of the Latin American Division of the Open Society Foundations, an elite globalist NGO founded by the Jewish financial capitalist George Soros, the single largest Democratic Party donor in the United States. He served in Lula’s cabinet the last time around. The Open Societies Foundations describes Abramovay in the following manner:</p><blockquote name="c0ec" id="c0ec" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Abramovay has held a series of key posts within Brazil’s Ministry of Justice: He was a special adviser to the Minister of Justice from 2004 to 2006, the ministry’s Secretary for Legislative Affairs from 2007 to 2010, and Secretary of Justice from 2010 to 2011. Under President Lula, Abramovay helped draft significant pieces of legislation.” (20)</em></blockquote><p name="d697" id="d697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Abramovay promised that this year would be “the big turning point from 2018 to 2022,” (21) and correctly predicted that Lula would be elected. When the riots broke out, Politico reported that Abramovay predicted violence coming out of Bolsonaro’s camp.” (22) He seems to be quite prescient.</p><p name="38aa" id="38aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether this Son of Abraham will be again appointed to Lula’s cabinet, we can only assume. The Rio Times, a generally pro-Bolsonaro paper, says that Abramovay has already been nominated for a cabinet position, but it is hard to find another source of better credibility. (23)</p><p name="043f" id="043f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us now put the globe-mongering Jew aside and address a globe-mongering Christian. Lula’s Vice President is Geraldo Alckmin, a member of the Party of Social Democracy. Alckmin is also a member of the World Economic Forum, and more importantly, his uncle, José Geraldo, was a member of the Prelature of Opus Dei, a notorious secret society run by the Vatican. (24) It thus seems probable that Alckmin is a member as well.</p><p name="0ee9" id="0ee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Opus Dei’s membership is quite bizarre, having in the past contained CIA directors, US politicians, aristocrats, Mafiosi, Freemasons, top officials in the governments of Franco, Mussolini, and Hitler, and so on. It is connected to influential think-tanks like the Heritage Foundation. Even the Jesuits, notorious for their extremism and secrecy, have condemned Opus Dei for its extremism and secrecy. A 1986 internal report by Belgian military police exposed Opus Dei’s diverse and elite membership, its methods of operation, and so forth. It reads:</p><blockquote name="66f5" id="66f5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“They recruit elites; indoctrinate future elites while at universities; create disinformation through media; use criminal goals to achieve their means, especially through the Mafia, Freemasons, etc.; create a climate of fear and insecurity among the population, ridiculing and destabilizing national traditions; compromise uncooperative leaders by any means; corrupt uncooperative youth by drugs, prostitution, etc.; use terror and blackmail to force reshuffling of state cabinets.” (25)</em></blockquote><p name="26b2" id="26b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is the organization which possesses an agent as Lula’s right-hand man. It is enough to know that, should Lula be “comprised by any means,” a member of Opus Dei-VP Alckmin-will become President of Brazil. Even Escobar acknowledges that “Alckmin can be catapulted to power the minute the deeply hostile Congress decides to impeach Lula.”</p><p name="42cf" id="42cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">THE INFLUENCE OF THE WEF</strong></p><p name="2174" id="2174" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We mentioned that Geraldo Alckmin is a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The WEF is a private conference closed to outsiders and guarded by armed security. It gathers a huge number of world leaders, capitalists, journalists, activists, actors, and more-Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and Volodomyr Zelensky, just to name a few-at a secluded resort in Davos, Switzerland, to devise political and social agendas. We will not delve into it here, but the reader should look into the organization if they have not already.</p><p name="65c3" id="65c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bolsonaro attended the WEF in 2019, where he gave a speech on “the New Brazil,” promising economic liberalization and foreign investment by global capital. (26) He sat at the same table as Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, and Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. WEF attendee Francesco Starace, CEO of the Italian energy company Enel, told CNBC that “whether it’s populist or not, we don’t care: Bolsonaro’s agenda is good for the country.”</p><p name="f86e" id="f86e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, the question is undeniable: Bolsonaro is, to some degree, an ally of global capital and the WEF. It is noteworthy that Cook, Nadella, and Starace are all industrialists rather than financiers.</p><p name="75ff" id="75ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Allegiances shifted after Bolsonaro was elected. In 2020, Bolsonaro’s spokesperson Otavio Barros said that “the President analyzed the economic and political aspects and decided that he should not participate in the WEF at this moment.” (27) He would abstain from the WEF for his entire presidency-and to his credit, this is more than Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping can claim.</p><p name="02f0" id="02f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is also more than Lula can claim. Lula attended the WEF in 2009 while still serving as President of Brazil, giving a speech calling for “globalization with ethics,” and passionately embracing the WEF’s founder and leader Klaus Schwab. (28) In 2010, Lula sent his Minister of Relations, Celso Amorim to attend the 2010 meeting, where Amorim “accepted the WEF’s first Global Statesmanship Award on behalf of Lula.” Schwab said that “Lula’s leadership was instrumental in delivering the results we all know about.” (29)</p><figure name="03ef" id="03ef" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*JvrCNO4whVFxLIv7" data-width="275" data-height="357" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JvrCNO4whVFxLIv7"></figure><p name="ed4d" id="ed4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Lula continued to attend the WEF even after he left office: he was photographed at the meeting in 2014, and in 2015 wrote an article calling for “a green alliance with Europe” in the WEF’s magazine, Project Syndicate. 18 (30) Now, he is pursuing this agenda: as Foreign Policy reports, “at the 2023 WEF, officials from Brazil and Colombia argued for higher taxation and green investment,” and also promised “to reinforce financial commitments.” We are told that “though he may seem out of place in the ultra-rich Swiss haven, Lula’s policy depends on foreign investment.” (31)</p><p name="6067" id="6067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Brazil’s President and Vice President are both members of the WEF. Davos, and not Brasilia, appears to be the real seat of the Brazilian Government. Now that we understand who is making the agenda, let us look at the agenda itself.</p><p name="7143" id="7143" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ENVIROMENTALISM AND DE-INDUSTRIALIZATION</strong></p><p name="6ca3" id="6ca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have said that Bolsonaro represents the globalist industrialists, and Lula represents the globalist financiers. This becomes most apparent in the policy of de-industrialization-or as liberals like to call it, “environmentalism”-pursued by Lula and combated by Bolsonaro.</p><p name="15aa" id="15aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “secret” behind environmentalism is the following: within a country, environmentalism is used by nearly all big financiers, as well as by certain industrial conglomerates (e.g. Ford and ExxonMobil), in order to prevent new competitors from entering the market. The theory of supply and demands holds that the greater a commodity’s general supply, the lower the value of the individual commodity. When resource-rich land is “preserved” and left undeveloped, or when industry is stifled with stringent regulations (such as those on CO2 emissions), the supply of a given commodity is restricted, preserving profits for those who already dominate the supply. This applies to logging, mining, etc., and even heavy industry.</p><p name="354e" id="354e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s an example: a big logging company, as well as the big bank financing the logging company, will promote anti-logging environmentalism, setting up massive “preservations” in the forests so that locals cannot enter the logging trade without risking arrest and conviction. It’s not very philanthropic or well- intentioned at all, which is why they so frequently rely on teenage activists to make it appear innocent.</p><p name="23c2" id="23c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This same principle applies on the international level: environmentalism is promoted by the globalist powers through NGOs, the UN, etc., to keep developing countries from industrializing and competing on the global market. In countries where “environmentalism” triumphs and industry is stifled, the national economy is unable to sustain itself by the refinement and export of domestic materials, and instead must rely on imports purchased with interest-heavy loans from foreign banks and international financial institutions like the IMF.</p><p name="d332" id="d332" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Time, a magazine founded by the CIA propagandist Henry Luce, writes that “Lula’s victory is a win for the planet.” (32) When Lula was recently elected, a group of American Senators-including Brian Schatz and Mitt Romney-signed an open letter “urging Luiz Inácio Lula to combat deforestation and work with US global partners.” (33) Why the Americans-who are the second-largest timber exporters in the world-would be so concerned with preventing the Brazilians from developing their timber industry is the reader’s guess.</p><p name="2412" id="2412" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Bolsonaro was faced with this sort of demand from the Group of Seven, he responded by calling it an “inappropriate and gratuitous attack… disguised as ‘saving’ the Amazon, as if it were a colony.” (34) But Lula, on the other hand, has completely acquiesced to the demands set before him. He recently announced that he is resuming a $1.2 billion “Amazon Fund” (with financing from Norway and Germany) to create logging- free zones in the rainforest. (35) He has also reestablished the “National Council for the Environment” and has launched “anti-deforestation raids” on “illegal loggers.” (36) He even suggested that “many” of the capitol rioters “could have been illegal miners or illegal loggers.” (37)</p><p name="f0c5" id="f0c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many of these operations are overseen by Marina Silva, Lula’s Minister of Environment. Financial Times calls Silva “an unflinching campaigner to save Brazil’s rainforest,” (38) and she has received extensive praise from the UN as well. AP reports the following:</p><blockquote name="3556" id="3556" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“President Lula announced Silva will be the next Minister of Environment. The announcement indicates the new administration will prioritize cracking down on illegal deforestation even if it means running afoul of powerful agribusiness interests. Both attended the recent UN climate conference, where Lula promised ‘zero deforestation’ in the Amazon. This would be a sharp turn from the policies of Bolsonaro, who pushed for development in the Amazon.” (39)</em></blockquote><p name="6bd5" id="6bd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When Lula promises “zero deforestation,” what he is really promising is “zero timber industry”-an industry which makes up 1.2% of Brazil’s GDP. Indeed, Lula explicitly attacked the industry, saying it “condemns the country to be an eternal exporter of raw materials.” (40) If he were restricting the export alone, so that raw materials could be used in domestic production, it would be one thing; but he appears to be fighting logging outright, stating in his inauguration:</p><blockquote name="0e18" id="0e18" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“When we cut down an ancient tree, we cut down a part of our own lives. My government will stop the destruction of the Amazon entirely. With us, it is safe forever.” (10)</em></blockquote><p name="717c" id="717c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This all might sound nice, but one would think a president should take care of his people before trees. The poorer Brazilians are due for a cold winter without firewood; and they’ll need good luck to fix homelessness while restricting the primary material for house- building. But at least the trees are happy.</p><p name="1f7b" id="1f7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We should also point out that wood is one of the single most sustainable and renewable resources on the planet. What do they plan to use for warmth and housing instead of wood? Gas and concrete? Surely, that is worse for the environment? One is reminded of the infamous interview where Mike Graham claimed it is possible to grow concrete just like trees.</p><p name="c55f" id="c55f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Timber is not the only thing on the agenda. In the name of protecting indigenous land, Lula is heavily restricting mining. In the UK, Corbyn praises Lula for this:</p><blockquote name="a1b4" id="a1b4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“By tackling illegal mining in the north, indigenous communities would no longer be systematically murdered by the greed for gold. ‘No price of gold,’ he said, ‘is worth anyone’s life.’” (10)</em></blockquote><p name="5e56" id="5e56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Gold is the most important commodity when it comes to international finance (fiat currency is mostly a charade for domestic consumers). Without mining their own gold, Brazilians will have to rely on foreign banks-the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which despite the name is a private institution (largely set up by Pierre Jay, a member of the Skull &amp; Bones Society), has the largest gold supply in the world.</p><p name="c811" id="c811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It cannot be said any other way: Lula is directly attacking the source of his country’s financial independence, and in doing so is likely rendering them further dependent on global finance.</p><p name="af44" id="af44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On top of this, it is probable that Lula will suppress not only gold mining, but also iron mining. Iron is Brazil’s single largest export, generating $44.7 billion USD a year. Iron is crucial for the steel industry, and for heavy industry in general. Thus, we see here a most direct attack on Brazilian industry.</p><p name="0ef0" id="0ef0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is strange is that Lula, for all his action against the logging and mining industries, does not seem to mind the oil industry, which is by far the most destructive to the environment. In November, Senator Jean Prates stated that Lula will not interfere with the oil company Petrobras, and that “things will happen by talking to the banks and investors.” (41) Felicity Bradstock assured readers in Oil Price, an American magazine for oil investors, that “Lula is unlikely to undermine the country’s oil industry.” (42)</p><p name="3e77" id="3e77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It should go without saying that Lula’s environmental agenda is backed by an environmental lobby. Let us go back to Lula’s Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva. In 2010, Silva met with Thomas Lovejoy and Stephen Schneider, two men of considerable importance.</p><p name="03fe" id="03fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Left-to-right: Thomas Lovejoy, Marina Silva, and Stephen Schneider in 2010.</p><p name="6798" id="6798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thomas Lovejoy is an ecologist who served as an advisor for Presidents Reagan, Bush Sr., and Clinton. He is a leading member of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the environmentalist organization with the cute little panda logo. The WWF was founded by a group of English, Dutch, and South African billionaires, mostly industrialists and aristocrats with connections to the UN, with its first president being Prince Bernhard Lippe-Biesterfeld, a man so extensively corrupt that we cannot concisely describe him here. For now, it’s enough to say he was a very close ally of the CIA and the Rockefeller oil dynasty.</p><p name="90f5" id="90f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The WWF operates by purchasing millions of acres in developing third-world countries and hiring mercenaries to brutally crack down on any locals who attempt to use the land for hunting, farming, etc. The WWF, by itself, owns about 150 million acres of rainforest in the Amazon, and plenty more land around the world. Through their “debt-for-nature scheme,” they offer to pay countries’ IMF debts in exchange for land- that scheme was created by Thomas Lovejoy, the man who met with Silva in 2010. The reader can find all types of articles on this in the mainstream media.</p><p name="607b" id="607b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s address Stephen Schneider, the other fellow who met with Silva. Schneider was a Stanford professor and one of the UN’s top climate scientists, working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the 1970s, he confidently warned that human CO2 emissions would lead to a man-made ice age within a few decades. After this didn’t happen, he began claiming human CO2 emissions would actually cause the planet to start overheating within a few decades. He also wrote the following about climatology in 1989:</p><blockquote name="9ff0" id="9ff0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“As scientists, we are ethically bound to tell the truth. But like most people, we’d like to see the world a better place. To do that, we need to capture the public’s imagination. That of course entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.” (43)</em></blockquote><p name="4cd3" id="4cd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In case there is any room for doubt, Dr. John Costella wrote an entire book, The Climategate Emails, demonstrating how Schneider and other IPCC scientists regularly engaged in academic fraud in order to secure large grants from environmental organizations, including the WWF.</p><p name="0f38" id="0f38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now, Lula promises “zero deforestation” at the COP27, the UN meeting which converts the IPCC’s recommendations and research-largely built on the work of the late Schneider-into policy.</p><p name="f23c" id="f23c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are we “denying climate change” by stating all of this? If so, we are in good company. Other “climate change deniers” include Richard Lindzen, who was one of the IPCC’s lead authors before declaring the institution was utterly compromised by government and business interests; John Coleman, the creator of the Weather Channel; Fred Singer and Steven Pruitt, two high-ranking officials of the US Environmental Protection Agency; and plenty more. Even Piers Corbyn, brother of Jeremy Corbyn, said that climate alarmism is a plot to shut down factories and prevent the development of the working class. Evidently, his brother never listened to him.</p><p name="d75d" id="d75d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">FOREIGN RELATIONS, CURRENCY AND IMMIGRATION</strong></p><p name="00ee" id="00ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Escobar writes:</p><blockquote name="c22e" id="c22e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The most significant part of Lula’s speech came at the end: Brazil, he said, would not be dragged into a new Cold War.

We’ve mentioned his kind words for Biden, and so we know that Lula, like Bolsonaro, will be somewhat close to the US. But his foreign policy can be distinguished from Bolsonaro’s in a few ways.</p><p name="11ac" id="11ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During his last tenure as President, Lula aligned Brazil with Palestine against Israel, contrary to the policy of Bolsonaro, who was an avid supporter of Israel (his wife was photographed wearing an Israeli flag shirt while voting during the recent election). And whereas Bolsonaro had some conflicts with the Group of Seven, Lula went as far as creating an entire rival alliance, the “BRICS+ Summit”, a conference between the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and a growing number of other countries. Escobar writes:</p><blockquote name="af55" id="af55" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Lula is immensely respected by Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. The drive towards a multipolar world, represented by bodies from BRICS+ to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, will profit immensely to have Lula on board. Brazil has been Beijing’s key trade partner in Latin America since 2009, absorbing roughly half of China’s investment in the region and firmly placed as the fifth largest exporter of oil for the Chinese market, second for iron2, and first for soybeans. The goodwill in Beijing is unshakeable: Lula is considered an old friend by China. He already stated BRICS will be at the center of his foreign policy. That may even include Lula formally signing up Brazil as a partner of the Belt and Road Initiative.” (Ibid).</em></blockquote><p name="10c3" id="10c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">One might be surprised to learn that Bolsonaro was actually somewhat close to China as well. Foreign Policy released an article during the recent election stating that “Beijing wants Bolsonaro to win” as he is “an ally against the West.” (44) However, he has criticized Chinese investment in Brazil, saying that “China is not buying in Brazil, it’s buying Brazil.” He also became the first Brazilian President to visit Taiwan, who in turn endorsed his candidacy. Bolsonaro thus loses favor to Lula, who, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wenbin, “is expected to bring ties with China to new heights.” (45)</p><p name="dc82" id="dc82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On 22 January, Lula met with Argentine President (and fellow WEF member) Alberto Fernandez to discuss economic cooperation, in particular the idea of creating a new “South American currency.” Finance Times reports:</p><blockquote name="3029" id="3029" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Brazil and Argentina are starting preparations for a common currency. Other Latin American nations will be invited to join plan which could create world’s second-largest currency union. Brazil and Argentina will this week announce that they are starting preparatory work on a common currency, in a move which could eventually create the world’s second-largest currency bloc. South America’s two biggest economies will discuss the plan at a summit in Buenos Aires this week and will invite other Latin American nations to join. The initial focus will be on how a new currency, which Brazil suggests calling the “sur” (south), could boost regional trade and reduce reliance on the US dollar, officials told the Financial Times. It would at first run in parallel with the Brazilian real and Argentine peso. “There will be . . . a decision to start studying the parameters needed for a common currency, which includes everything from fiscal issues to the size of the economy and the role of central banks,” Argentina’s economy minister Sergio Massa told the Financial Times. “It would be a study of mechanisms for trade integration,” he added. “I don’t want to create any false expectations . . . it’s the first step on a long road which Latin America must travel.” Initially a bilateral project, the initiative would be offered to other nations in Latin America. “It is Argentina and Brazil inviting the rest of the region,” the Argentine minister said. A currency union that covered all of Latin America would represent about 5 per cent of global GDP, the FT estimates. The world’s largest currency union, the euro, encompasses about 14 per cent of global GDP when measured in dollar terms. Other currency blocs include the CFA franc which is used by some African countries and pegged to the euro, and the East Caribbean dollar. However these encompass a much smaller slice of global economic output. The project is likely to take many years to come to fruition; Massa noted that it took Europe 35 years to create the euro. (46)</em></blockquote><p name="6fd5" id="6fd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Such a currency will reduce the dependence of Brazil on North American and European finance. However, considering it is not a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Brazilian </em>currency, but a “South American” currency (at least encompassing Argentina and Brazil, with more possibly joining), then it will also mean an increased level of dependence between the South American countries. A shared currency will naturally lead to, as Massa put it, “trade integration,” i.e. economic integration, which in turn gives rise to all other forms of integration: political, cultural, social, etc.</p><p name="cd09" id="cd09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If political integration reaches a stage where Brazil and other countries begin seeking a sort of “South American Union,” this could ultimately mean the beginning of large-scale immigration throughout South America. Such a thing would have the natural effect of reducing the wages of workers in the wealthier countries by forcing them to compete with cheap imported labor from abroad (and also draining labor from the poorer countries by sending them to work abroad).</p><p name="e49d" id="e49d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For instance, the average monthly income in Argentina is about $1,000, while the average monthly income in Brazil is about $600. Economic and political integration between the two countries would inevitably result in a large migration of Brazilian workers into Argentina, causing a labor shortage in Brazil while drastically lowering wages in Argentina. Argentina’s demographic composition would be threatened; and the relatively low rate of crime in Argentina would quickly increase as more Brazilians entered the country. This dynamic would also occur if, for example, Colombia or Venezuela joined this pact, causing many of their citizens to migrate into Brazil.</p><p name="dd06" id="dd06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bolsonaro, unsurprisingly, is against immigration. He has said that “the vast majority of immigrants do not have good intentions.” (47) He added: “I was against our last immigration law which made Brazil a country without borders. We cannot allow the indiscriminate entry of all those who come here.” (48)</p><blockquote name="48af" id="48af" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">When a Workers’ Party member yelled, “If the immigrants were Swedish, you wouldn’t have a problem,” Bolsonaro responded: “Hey, idiot, do you think the Swedes would want this garbage? Let’s put 10 million people from Venezuela or from North Africa there. Cool, huh? Like how we filled São Paulo with Haitians.” (49)</em></blockquote><p name="d514" id="d514" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Lula actually expressed this same sentiment during his campaign (because it is an almost universal opinion among workers). He stated in August of 2022:</p><blockquote name="b5e7" id="b5e7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The Federal Police needs more people. It’s necessary for us to deal with our borders.” (50)</em></blockquote><p name="daba" id="daba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But one of Lula’s first acts after resuming office was to re-enter Brazil into the UN’s “Global Pact for Migration,” which it had left in 2019 under the direction of Bolsonaro. (51) Whether this means migration into or out of Brazil, we will have to wait and see.</p><p name="c2ec" id="c2ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it means migration out of Brazil, then the Brazilian workers will have little incentive to care about improving their livelihoods when they can simply immigrate to better conditions abroad.</p><p name="e6ca" id="e6ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it means migration into Brazil, then we will see the lowering of wages and worsening of conditions in Brazil, since any strike or labor action can be broken with cheap migrants from abroad. Considering Brazil’s low birthrates, mass immigration would cause the gradual replacement of the whole Brazilian people (black and white and indigenous) by immigrants from the Hispanic countries and perhaps also from Africa. The UN, which backs Lula’s immigration policy, is not afraid of such a thing: they explicitly endorsed demographic replacement in their 2001 publication Replacement Migration: A Solution to Aging Populations?</p><p name="1945" id="1945" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With all that Lula has been doing, and with his longstanding servility to the UN, it seems very likely that “replacement migration” is on the agenda for Brazil.</p><p name="5a8f" id="5a8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">GUN CONTROL AND CRIME</strong></p><p name="9323" id="9323" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next major question on Lula’s agenda is the mass disarmament of the population, or as the liberals euphemistically refer to it, “gun control.”</p><p name="d380" id="d380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reader should not need an explanation of the purpose of disarmament. The simple logic is this: the less people are armed, the less they can resist force, and the less dangerous it is to exploit them. Lenin once declared that “anybody who does not strive to bear arms deserves to be treated like a slave.”</p><p name="4241" id="4241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2003, Lula passed a strict law which led to the confiscation of about 500,000 firearms. This legislation was the work of none other than Pedro Abramovay, the Soros agent we discussed earlier. The Open Societies Foundation writes:</p><blockquote name="5cf0" id="5cf0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Under President Lula, Abramovay led a campaign that resulted in the removal of an estimated half- million guns from circulation.” (20)</em></blockquote><p name="3587" id="3587" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When Bolsonaro was elected, he reversed all of Lula’s gun control laws. He stated that “everyone should buy a rifle,” because “an armed population can never be enslaved.” (52)</p><p name="867f" id="867f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During Bolsonaro’s presidency, the amount of registered gun owners rose from 117,467 to 673,818. (53) By 2021, Brazil had 1 million legal weapons in circulation, more than any other point in the country’s history. (54) That same year, the amount of intentional homicides in Brazil dropped by 7% to 41,100, the lowest amount since the Brazilian Public Security Forum began recording such data in 2007. (55)</p><p name="aa12" id="aa12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since resuming office, Lula has already passed newer, stricter gun laws: minors are banned from training with firearms, citizens may now only own three firearms (down from fifteen), no new firearms training clubs are allowed to be founded, and it is now illegal to transport loaded weapons. (56) Flavio Dino, the head of Lula’s transition team, said that Lula plans to completely remove guns from circulation:</p><blockquote name="d1be" id="d1be" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The revocation will occur. Regarding what is going to happen with the existing arsenals, there are two ideas. One is to say that it is illegal and that’s it. The other is to create tougher, more rigorous taxation, which creates an economic burden for the existing arsenals.” (57)</em></blockquote><p name="4781" id="4781" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Lula and his administration portray these actions as combating crime-despite crime hitting its lowest point when gun possession was the highest, as we’ve already said. During Lula’s first term, Antonio Rangel Bandeira, an “expert on armed violence” (hopefully not from experience), explained to the United Press:</p><blockquote name="4f63" id="4f63" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Reducing violence has been one of Lula’s main concerns. Gun control is an important step in that direction, as the vast majority of Brazil’s crimes and homicides are committed with firearms.” (58)</em></blockquote><p name="ba4f" id="ba4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What Bandeira says is quite curious. Lula, on the direction of Abramovay, is banning firearms because they cause crime. Yet about Abramovay, the Open Societies Foundations writes that he “worked on reform of Brazil’s penitentiary system” under Lula, pushing for soft-on-crime policies similar to those supported by Soros in the US. (20)</p><p name="677c" id="677c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They’re banning guns because they’re hard on crime; but they’re absolving criminals because they’re soft on crime. Lula pushes policies which allow criminals to get back on the streets; and then bans guns because they cause too much crime to be allowed on the streets. Good luck to the Brazilians, who must now win unarmed street fights with convicts.</p><p name="c181" id="c181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">RACIAL IDENTITY POLITICS</strong></p><p name="704b" id="704b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Identity politics” are a trademark of modern liberalism.

The law exists to defend the majority.” (60)</em></blockquote><p name="c1a1" id="c1a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To the contrary, Lula believes Brazil is for the minorities, and his platform is largely catered to minorities. Escobar writes that “Lula emphasized a ‘relentless fight against racism, prejudice, and discrimination.’” Corbyn writes that “Lula gave an incredibly moving speech where he pledged to end hunger, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and deforestation.” (10) One would think “ending racism and hunger” is a bit of a utopian campaign promise, but we digress.</p><p name="06c8" id="06c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All this talk of race is a bit odd, since it seems to be borrowed directly from the Americans, and doesn’t quite fit the conditions of Brazil. Brazil is about 47% White, 43% Mixed, and 8% Black. When slavery ended in the 1880s (by the decree of the white Princess Isabel), there was not really a proceeding era of racial segregation like in the US. On the contrary, the Brazilians actively encouraged intermarriage and racial mixing, and even adopted so-called “racial democracy” as a civic doctrine. Regardless of what can be said of the intermixing and whether it was beneficial, it certainly rendered racial discrimination difficult, since so many Brazilians were left with both European and African features. This is why Bolsonaro argued:</p><blockquote name="ba3c" id="ba3c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Racism is rare in Brazil. I’m fed up with this mania of always pitting blacks against whites… Leftists are ignorant about the Brazilian people, who are mixed.” (61)</em></blockquote><p name="b696" id="b696" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What is Lula’s idea of “anti-racism”? The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) praises Lula for “taking on one of Brazil’s glaring examples of racial inequality: that 42% of Blacks have no schooling, and only 1.41% have an advanced degree.” (62) This is apparently the fault of racism and racial discrimination, despite the fact that Brazil never enforced racial segregation in schools.</p><p name="4d30" id="4d30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NACLA says that Lula combated these inequalities by “supporting affirmative action.” If the reader is not familiar with “affirmative action,” here is an example: Yahoo News reported that Brazil’s first female President, Dilma Rousseff-a member of Lula’s Workers’ Party who was later impeached for violating budget laws-”signed a controversial law in 2010 that reserved 50% of spots in public universities to black, mixed race, or indigenous students,” and in 2015, “set a 20% quota for Black judges” and other government employees. (63)</p><p name="8a28" id="8a28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, Whites were barred from 50% of school spots and 20% of government positions on the basis of their race, while a sizable number of Blacks received such positions on the basis of their race. That is affirmative action, and it actually is racial discrimination, the kind that previously did not exist in Brazil.</p><p name="00d0" id="00d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even the BBC, who are well-known for their liberal bias, state that “Black activists have campaigned for racial quotas in Brazil,” while “many argue that affirmative action policies should not be implemented because most of the population is mixed race and many regard the country as a ‘racial democracy.’” (64) It is also blatantly self-destructive: Bolsonaro rightly argued that “one wouldn’t enter an airplane flown by a quota pilot or accept to be operated on by a quota doctor.” (65) And Lula himself can attest that one certainly wouldn’t want a quota judge, either.</p><p name="5a56" id="5a56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since Brazil is so mixed, how does the state determine when someone is deserving of affirmative action policies? How is it determined if someone is “Black” or not? What if a mixed person with ¾ European heritage and ¼ African heritage considers himself African, or vice versa?</p><p name="08c5" id="08c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The solution is simple. In 2016, President Rousseff created eugenical race boards; NPR reported at the time that “to help affirmative action, Brazil has created controversial boards for determining race.” (66) They stated:</p><blockquote name="4b0f" id="4b0f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Lucas Siqueira’s high mark on the Foreign Service exam earned him a position at Brazil’s highly competitive Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Blacks can’t help themselves: they get served after the white guy at the café, and have no choice but to start murdering and raping innocent children (mostly other blacks). Or the courts are rigged against them, and the mostly-black victims are lying. Even WEB Dubois, the black founder of the NAACP in the US, was not persuaded by the “rigged courts” argument.</p><p name="f69e" id="f69e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lula is willing to complain of the “whites with blue eyes,” but he will not say a word about the statistically demonstrable crimes of blacks, instead choosing to weep endlessly over “racism” in Brazil. Why should whites be sorry for having bad <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thoughts </em>about a people who <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">physically </em>victimize them?

Many black activists in Brazil are pressuring the government to force the white working class to pay “reparations” in the name of slavery. Do they think it will help blacks to make them collectively dependent on whites for income? And do they think whites won’t retaliate against such blatant exploitation? And it should be said that the largest portion of whites immigrated to Brazil after the abolition of slavery. Bolsonaro made a fitting argument:</p><blockquote name="c177" id="c177" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“What debt of slavery?

One only needs to do a cursory look into the history of African slavery to learn how most of the transatlantic trade entailed African and Arab princes selling captured tribes to each other and to Europeans traders. Few mention how Dahomey fought an entire war with the French in order to preserve slavery, and how the second-largest slave society in history was Sokoto, which held 2.5 million slaves by 1804. King Gezo of Dahomey declared “the slave trade is the ruling principle of my people,” while King Bonny of Nigeria said that “the trade is ordained by God.” One of the most famous slave traders in history, Tippu Tip, was a Bantu Arab. Wherever slavery was abolished, it was largely forced by the Europeans during the process of colonization.</p><p name="9d29" id="9d29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Very few people make any mention of the fact that the African country of Mauritiana still has not abolished slavery, with 25% of the population being slaves.

(73) If not for the Portuguese, many of Brazil’s Blacks would still be in slavery.</p><p name="9776" id="9776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why is Lula pushing all of these racial doctrines? Using what is taken from the Euro-Brazilians, Lula is bribing the Afro-Brazilians to enforce his agenda, and thus the agenda of globalism in general. Due to these bribes, blacks unwaveringly support Lula: according to Datafolha, a leading data research group in Brazil, “it is among the Black population where Lula has the greatest advantage,” and “poor black women ensure Lula’s leadership in this year’s presidential race.” (74) Among Blacks, Lula led Bolsonaro by a margin of over 50%.</p><p name="0e56" id="0e56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the Afro-Brazilian minority suddenly disappeared or was disenfranchised, Brazil would be taking an entirely different political direction, one more in line with the interests of the Euro-Brazilian majority. Assimilation has long been the chosen route. But with the blacks so acutely antagonizing the whites-violently terrorizing the whites and claiming to be victimized by white police and judges when facing consequences; being favored by discrimination against the whites in jobs and government; and still further demanding the whites pay them money-it seems inevitable that the white majority, who despite all obstacles still dominate the military and state apparatuses, will eventually settle on a forcible solution far more extreme than anything attempted by the “fascist” Bolsonaro.</p><p name="86bb" id="86bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">SEXUAL IDENTITY POLITICS</strong></p><p name="c75e" id="c75e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sexual identity politics has two functions: first, to create an easily-manipulated group of “oppressed” who identify themselves entirely on the basis of their sexual practices, and whose interests are exclusive from the general interests of society; and second, to facilitate the global project to decrease fertility rates (the first sexual activist group, the World League for Sexual Reform, included members like Charles Drysdale, a leading depopulation advocate from the Malthusian League- we’ll talk more about depopulation in a moment).</p><p name="e51c" id="e51c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We quoted Corbyn stating that “Lula gave an incredibly moving speech where he pledged to end homophobia and transphobia.” One would think there are more pressing issues in Brazil than removing social boundaries for men who cross-dress and have anal sex-like for instance, how 47,500 Brazilian women and girls are raped every year, with 51% of them being under the age of 13. Before long, the Brazilians will be forcing those girls to share bathrooms and showers with old men in skirts, as we already seeing elsewhere.

The Rockefellers have been particularly active: John Rockefeller III and CIA Director Allen Dulles created the Population Council in 1952. The notorious Jaffe Memo, sent to the Population Council from Planned Parenthood (another depopulation advocacy group) discusses the use of abortion, contraceptives, fertility control agents in the water supply, homosexuality, easy divorce, feminism, and more as possible methods of decreasing the world’s fertility rate.

Lula also said in 2021 that “abortion should be turned into a public health issue, and everyone should have the right and not be ashamed.” (Ibid).</p><p name="363e" id="363e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As to whether Lula promotes contraceptives, the other major tool of depopulation, the answer is a complete affirmative. According to AP, back in 2007, one of his first acts in office was to launch a massive tax- funded program that provided contraceptives throughout 10,000 pharmacies, as well as a number of free vasectomies. Lula went as far as admitting it was a form of population control, saying “the plan will give low-income Brazilians the same right that the wealthy have to plan the number of children they want.” (89) AP points out that “the announcement came after Pope Benedict XVI said that legalized contraception is a threat to the future of the peoples of Latin America.</p><p name="a86c" id="a86c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">VACCINES</strong></p><p name="4cac" id="4cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Knowing that Lula supports population control, we should briefly consider the mRNA vaccine rollout that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rollout was pushed by people like Bill Gates, who has spent his life fortune producing and promoting vaccines, and who in a 2010 TED talk, Innovating to Zero, stated that “the world population is heading up to 9 billion, but if we do a really good job on vaccines, we could lower that by perhaps 10% to 15%.” (90) The top source of funding from the World Health Organization (WHO), which coordinated the pandemic response and vaccine rollout on a global scale, is Germany, which contributes $1.2 billion a year; the second largest donor is not any country, but the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which contributes $751 million a year. Another big donor is the UN Development Program, the UN organization which administers the “UN Population Fund”. (91) Try to guess what that’s for, reader.</p><p name="1d9e" id="1d9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, even Gates admits that the vaccines did not work as advertised, and it is becoming increasingly mainstream knowledge (thanks in part to documentaries like Died Suddenly and whistleblowers like Robert Malone, the father of mRNA vaccines) that the vaccines do in fact have serious and possibly lethal side effects, including blood clotting, myocarditis, and various others).</p><p name="ffb6" id="ffb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will not get into all of that here. We simply wish to understand Bolsonaro and Lula’s positions on the vaccines and allow them to speak for themselves.</p><p name="ef54" id="ef54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bolsonaro openly stated he refused to take the vaccine out of health concerns, and warned others to do 55 the same. Confusingly, it was under Bolsonaro that the Ministry of Health bought 20 million pediatric vaccines developed by Pfizer and issued them for use on children as young as five-a group virtually untouched by the pandemic. Yet, according to Reuters, “Bolsonaro warned that Pfizer has not assumed responsibility for any side effects the vaccine could have in children, and said parents should immediately seek a doctor if their child developed chest pains or shortage of breath.” He denounced the idea of giving vaccines to children, stating:</p><blockquote name="8dfd" id="8dfd" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Are you going to vaccinate your child when the possibility of dying is almost zero? What is behind this? What are the interests of vaccine maniacs?” (92)</em></blockquote><p name="e85f" id="e85f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Hopefully, browsing YouTube in his new Miami home, Bolsonaro will stumble upon the video of Gates explaining precisely what his interests are. He won’t be able to comment on it, because he’s been banned from Facebook and YouTube for claiming mRNA vaccines might cause AIDS (they probably don’t, but close enough); he was investigated by the Brazilian Supreme Court for those comments as well. (93)</p><p name="7d14" id="7d14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bolsonaro refused to enact a lockdown during the pandemic, stating that “no town mayor or state governor can prevent a child from going to school for not being vaccinated.” For such policies, the Senate recommended that he be charged with crimes against humanity, which is ironic, since locking people in their homes and forcing them to be injected with an experimental serum at the risk of their livelihood is in fact a crime against humanity (and it deserves the death penalty). 56</p><p name="0782" id="0782" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, what about Lula’s opinion? He was not in power during the COVID pandemic, but he began campaigning in 2021, and thus was in the public view. In the same speech where he referred to Biden as “a breath of democracy for the world,” he declared that “the leaders of the world must focus on one thing: vaccines, vaccines, vaccines!” He added, rather pitifully:</p><p name="8b64" id="8b64" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The responsibility to international leaders is tremendous so I’m asking President Biden to do that because I can’t-I don’t believe in my government.” (16)</p><p name="b9c9" id="b9c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within Brazil, Lula is pushing vaccines as adamantly as he can. He said during an interview:</p><blockquote name="622c" id="622c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Now the campaign will begin. It is a question of science. If one must take 10 COVID vaccines, 50, I will take as many as necessary because I like my life. I think everyone has a duty to their children’s life, take them to be vaccinated.” (94)</em></blockquote><p name="d776" id="d776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That’s “science”, according to Lula. And equipped with this “science”, he adamantly pushes for vaccinations even though the pandemic is mostly over. TeleSur reported in January of 2023 that “President Lula announced that he will start a campaign to encourage COVID-19 vaccination.” They quote Health Secretary Ethel Marciel, who said “science has returned to Brazil” with the election of Lula, and that “Brazil will follow all the WHO’s recommendations”-thus, all the recommendations of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. (95) At the direction of these organizations, the vaccine rollout is now intensifying in Brazil.
