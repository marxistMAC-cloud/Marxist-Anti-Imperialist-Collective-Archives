After the fall of Assad and the establishment of a Turkish comprador fascist regime, we can see that the Iraqi state is being forced to reorganize. An election is the perfect tool for this, when exploiters play their cat-and-mouse games right in front of the masses.</p><p name="2ee8" id="2ee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This Iraqi state, reduced to nothing by America in 2003 (which was the real objective of the invasion: not oil as social-democrats pretend, not Israel’s interests as civic nationalists pretend, but the destruction of the nation-state in order to commercialize globalization), now functions only through the competing interests of particular warlords.</p><p name="8f58" id="8f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One well-known warlord was (normally we should call him Sayyed, but I do not respect him enough) Moqtada al-Sadr, the son of a major religious family martyred under Saddam. He first led an anti-American militia after 2003, then reinvented himself as a populist leader claiming to fight corruption and foreign interference (but strangely, only the Iranian kind). A pathological liar who chose to sink into delirious sectarianism, refusing to help save Syria from the Islamo-fascist offensive, refusing to take part in uprisings, and refusing to demand the withdrawal of American troops.</p><p name="ab2e" id="ab2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This Moqtada declared a mass boycott, closing his eyes to the dramatic situation his country is facing. Why? Because Moqtada, a frontline puppet of the Turks, needs Washington to guide him. When a new form of ISIS advances, he will serve as a Shia fig leaf.</p><p name="c524" id="c524" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other side, we have the forces of resistance, mainly weakened by the liberal reforms imposed at gunpoint. To quote <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/iraqs-security-2003-2019-death-and-neoliberal-destruction-par-excellence/" data-href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/iraqs-security-2003-2019-death-and-neoliberal-destruction-par-excellence/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">OpenDemocracy</em></a></p><blockquote name="cf43" id="cf43" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Iraq, however, is a different story, in the sense that an exceptionally harsh neoliberal restructuring was introduced by a military invasion, led by the US army, in the most brutal and boldest way ever seen in the world. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, led by the Bush administration in the US, turned Iraq into a neoliberal utopia. When Saddam Hussein’s regime was defeated and replaced by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), headed by Paul Bremer, a series of extensive neoliberal measures were quickly introduced in its first month without any waiting period, from privatisation of 200 Iraqi state-owned companies to reducing corporate tax from 45 percent to 15 percent, and from allowing foreign firms to retain 100 percent of their Iraqi assets to a complete restructuring the Iraqi banking system. Iraq’s oil revenues were put in a US-dominated development fund, the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), held in an account at the Federal Reserve in New York and used for restructuring expenditure. According to US government-appointed audit reports to the US Congress in 2004, 2005 and 2006, from the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction (SIGIR), there was poor delivery of contracts, overcharging, embezzlement, and general fraud by private contractors, and $8.8 billion of the $23 billion money held at DFI account remains unaccounted for.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="2720" id="2720" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Coalition Provisional Authority ran the occupation regime during its first 14 months and directed the most extreme version of neoliberal restructuring put in practice ever in the world, enforcing the market as the organising and regulative principle of the state and society. Even the IMF was alarmed and advised a more cautious approach. In less than 14 months, Paul Bremer issued 26 orders, as a result of which the Iraqi state was deprived of economic sovereignty and control of its own affairs. More than half a million Iraqi citizens abruptly lost their jobs, after which over 50 percent of the workforce became unemployed. The whole extensive neoliberal ‘shock programme of economic reforms’ was described by the Economist in September 2003 as a ‘Capitalist Dream’.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="b7f9" id="b7f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">(…)</em></blockquote><blockquote name="f35c" id="f35c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">During the first year of the occupation, about $50 billion of reconstruction contracts were commissioned to various US corporations, including Halliburton, Bechtel, SkylinkUSA, Stevedoring Services of America, and BearingPoint. During the same period, only 2 percent of the contracts were given to Iraqi firms. Research by the Financial Times showed in 2013 that the top 10 American and foreign contractors in Iraq secured business worth at least $72 billion between them. Prof David Whyte of Liverpool University describes this economic performance of the Coalition Provisional Authority as ‘one of the most audacious and spectacular crimes of theft in modern history. … The suspension of the normal rule of law by the occupying powers, in turn, encouraged Coalition Provisional Authority tolerance of, and participation in, the theft of public funds in Iraq. State-corporate criminality in the case of occupied Iraq must therefore be understood as part of a wider strategy of political and economic domination’.</em></blockquote><p name="6b13" id="6b13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But these reforms only intensified in the following decades.</p><p name="484e" id="484e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real duel, beyond a few mediocre organizations, was between two poles: (1) Sadr’s boycott, and (2) the resistance. In the end, who won? Abstention fell by 10 points compared to the previous election, which means a total defeat. On the other hand, Shia militias won 119 seats in Parliament. Let’s quote <a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the imperialists</a> crying over it:</p><blockquote name="3364" id="3364" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Indeed, the reverberations from this election will be felt across the region. Tehran has gained an institutional victory-achieved not through tanks or proxies launching rockets, but through ballot boxes. Iran’s strategy in Iraq has long relied on embedding its allies within state institutions, gradually transforming the government from within. The 2025 election represents the culmination of that project. Armed groups that once operated in the shadows now legislate openly, claiming democratic legitimacy.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="c8c5" id="c8c5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">This outcome is also inseparable from the mass withdrawal of the Sadrist movement, which left a vacuum the militias eagerly filled. The Sadrist boycott was intended as a protest against the corruption and dysfunction of the political system, but its practical effect was to hand unprecedented influence to pro-Iran factions. Without a counterweight capable of mobilizing millions of voters, the electoral arena became unbalanced, allowing a minority with disciplined organizational networks and large financial resources to dominate.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="cfb7" id="cfb7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The broader question now confronting Iraqis is unmistakable: Where is the country heading? The answer lies in these alliances and these numbers, which do not signal democratic transformation but rather a new phase of internal occupation-this time not through foreign armies, but through militias seated beneath the dome of parliament and shielded by the veneer of electoral legitimacy.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="6198" id="6198" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">For many Iraqis who dreamed of a state built on the rule of law and robust institutions, the 2025 election feels like a setback of historic proportions. The parliament, once envisioned as an arena for national representation, risks becoming a stage for regional power plays. The country is edging closer to a model where the state exists in form but not in function, caught between rival armed groups whose loyalty lies beyond Iraq’s borders.</em></blockquote><p name="a43b" id="a43b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But we also have a surprise winner in these elections: the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which passed the symbolic one-million-vote mark. This symbolizes something very important: the radicalization of Kurdish nationalism in Iraq, linked to the development of a proletariat and to the capitulation of the SDF to the Turkish regime and its allies (by the way, well done to the Western left for proving how absurd your Rojava fantasies were).</p><p name="67d1" id="67d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The scenario of an anti-imperialist Kurdish nationalist movement, allied with resistance groups and opposed to local warlords, is entirely possible and rooted in objective conditions. The question now is: how do we direct this alliance onto the path of socialism and communism?</p><p name="a5fa" id="a5fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">G.
