Once i readed Ruhnama, it is when it became obvious to me why USSR fell in such an</p><p name="b52a" id="b52a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">easy way, why the most communist state in the world is also the most explicit nationalist and</p><p name="504a" id="504a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">one of the few non-multinational ever (DPRK). You dont need to take Niyazov at his word for the</p><p name="da41" id="da41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">things he is describing (through i think most of them is true), but his writings on Russia and</p><p name="ce9c" id="ce9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">USSR say something which is a critique of chauvinism in general, Soviet one included.</p><p name="8225" id="8225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Russian communists try to hold accountable all non-Russian nations who fought against</p><p name="a97e" id="a97e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">them in WW2, but when it comes to them, they refuse to self-critique most of the time.

We should digest the spirit of sovereignty and freedom that independence has</p><p name="f95c" id="f95c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">brought. Once our independent state consolidated, some politicians, economists, and journalists</p><p name="6bf3" id="6bf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">who viewed themselves as the guardians of democracy, knowing that I made natural gas,</p><p name="9d8e" id="9d8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">electricity, water, and salt free for my people, advised me: – Nothing is free in a free market</p><p name="564b" id="564b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">economy. Economics prefers transaction. That is the rule of economics. Indeed, economics does</p><p name="9e01" id="9e01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">have rules. For we are humans after all. However, I absolutely believe that man should not be a</p><p name="7a45" id="7a45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">slave to the rules of economics. On the contrary, the rules of economics must serve mankind.</p><p name="4e64" id="4e64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some months ago i readed a newly released article by the Workers Party of Korea named «On the</p><p name="8272" id="8272" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">princible of independence» in Urimizzokiri where they call out both USSR and implicitly PRC for</p><p name="df3a" id="df3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">chauvinism, and they use preety much similar arguements.</p><p name="eabd" id="eabd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The importance of self-support in the economy in carving out the destiny of a country, nation</p><p name="125b" id="125b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">and the people can be seen through the issue of the Council for Mutual Economic Aid (COMECON)</p><p name="808a" id="808a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">which was under hot debate in the period when there existed the socialist camp. With the advent</p><p name="f947" id="f947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">of modern revisionism in socialist countries, the great-power chauvinists forced all the socialist</p><p name="e54a" id="e54a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">countries to join the COMECON on the basis of the theories of «international division of labour»</p><p name="c04b" id="c04b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">and an «integrated economy», in disregard of the basic demand of the people who share their</p><p name="1c61" id="1c61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">destiny with nation-state as a unit. In the initial days of building socialism, the DPRK was also</p><p name="3c7a" id="3c7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">under pressure from the great-power chauvinists. In view of the country’s level of economic</p><p name="b90a" id="b90a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">development which was lower than that of the socialist countries in Europe, it was obvious that</p><p name="beb1" id="beb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the DPRK would never have been well-off but would have got on subserviently, if it lived on</p><p name="b428" id="b428" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">selling coal, gold and other mineral resources while placing its economic lifeblood in the hands of</p><p name="16d8" id="16d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">others. President Kim Il Sung who had invariably regarded the principle of independence as the</p><p name="1beb" id="1beb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">lifeblood of revolution and construction turned down the big-power chauvinists’ pressure on the</p><p name="8a76" id="8a76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">country to enter the COMECON, starting from the Korean people’s demand for independence, and</p><p name="b795" id="b795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">chose the untrodden path of building an independent national economy without hesitation.</p><p name="7228" id="7228" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Socialism in those countries that had acceded to the COMECON in compliance with other’s</p><p name="6eca" id="6eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">intention and demand broke down in the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet Union. But the</p><p name="dd2b" id="dd2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">DPRK that had built a self-supporting national economy in strict adherence to the interests of the</p><p name="8af0" id="8af0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">country and the people has remained a fortress of independence despite the world’s political</p><p name="657c" id="657c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">upheaval, an eloquent testimony to the great significance of self-sustenance in the economy in</p><p name="6176" id="6176" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">hewing out the destiny of a country, nation and people.</p><p name="70a6" id="70a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that communists have too much focused on political economy thus far, neglecting the</p><p name="e346" id="e346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">«sociological» aspect of marxism. There is not only base, but superstructure too which in turn</p><p name="7ff2" id="7ff2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">exercises influence on the base, and we have a lot to gain if we study what the Post-Soviet</p><p name="7925" id="7925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">nationalists are saying, if not to agree with them, to see their arguement. It is no coincidence</p><p name="cce7" id="cce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">that both Kim Il Sung and Niyazov believed pretty much similar things regarding their relations</p><p name="b8a2" id="b8a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">to USSR, the difference is that communism is still politically acceptable in Korean nationalist</p><p name="5e90" id="5e90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">circles because there is no link between that ideology and a multinational formation and non-</p><p name="5ede" id="5ede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">korean dominated state, while for Turkeminstan, there is. I think that had USSR did not exist to</p><p name="c51d" id="c51d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">begin with, the nationalist intellectuals of Turkeminstan would not have abandoned marxism and</p><p name="2f76" id="2f76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">would propably fare much better today, since they would have kept most fundations of</p><p name="9a91" id="9a91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">proletarian dictactorship.</p><p name="ca00" id="ca00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the communists are against self-determination, the masses become preys to bourgeois</p><p name="bb3a" id="bb3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">hegemony if the bourgeoisie promises them self-determination. The nation exists outiside of</p><p name="5b31" id="5b31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">class struggle, class struggle only shapes its course, but we could take all people of a X nation,</p><p name="3c14" id="3c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">send them in the moon, and establish a classless society there, and they would still be human</p><p name="9472" id="9472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">beings belonging to a separate nation than the rest of the nations of the earth.</p><p name="b7fc" id="b7fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This fact was awknoledged by young Stalin, which was why he opposed so much russian</p><p name="bfb0" id="bfb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">chauvinism within USSR and CPSU. It is this acknowledgment by Stalin which pushed me</p><p name="7c89" id="7c89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">towards my abandonment of most of my «crude» anti-imperialism where the national question is</p><p name="bea3" id="bea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">mostly just a «political» weapon (i.e if they are «pro-russia, pro-china» we support them, if they</p><p name="f668" id="f668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">aren’t, we don’t). It is a fallacy, since by denying them support we push them directly in the</p><p name="9342" id="9342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">hands of the imperialists. When the CPC cries about how the Uygurs are «western agents» they</p><p name="e5a8" id="e5a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">are completelly dishonest; why are the Uygurs so full of compradorist elements but the</p><p name="4ab8" id="4ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mandarins are not?
