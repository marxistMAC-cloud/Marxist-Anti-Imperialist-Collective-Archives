It is obvious that the protests were mass ones, with participation of a great deal of the proletarian masses of the country, from both nations of Sri Lanka, both Sinhalese and Tamil. Plenty of anti-imperialists have shown support for the government, or been skeptical of the protests, but what is obvious is that this government has lost support from the majority of the population and cannot stand no matter what. In our opinion, it is not an anti-imperialist or national bourgeoisie government neither regarding its internal or international position, so it is not worthy of our support. With these in mind, we announce the following points:</p><p name="fbaa" id="fbaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1) We support the proletariat factions of the protests, the various red trade unions, JVP, and the socialist and nationalist anti-imperialist organizations of the protests. We oppose, or at least remain critical, of the liberal bourgeoisie opposition who seem to have taken the lead of the protests. We call for the proletariat leaders in the protests to not let this chance loose, and to not let themselves lose the leadership of the proletarian mass, which the majority probably organized spontaneously, to the bourgeoisie. If the new bourgeoisie government proves to be a national bourgeoisie one, with the support of the proletariat and its organizations, a government which will put Sri Lanka into the anti-imperialist road (or at least, the anti-imperialist road that can be followed under the context of capitalism), then we will trust the proletariat organizations in their decision and we will follow their heed. As of now, we oppose the liberals, we support the socialists turning this spontaneous revolt into a proper proletariat revolution.</p><p name="b244" id="b244" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2) We know that Sri Lanka came from a bloody civil war, mainly due to the chronic Sinhalese Chauvinism against the Tamil nation, which refused to recognize the self-determination of the Tamils. Consistent with the worldview of Mac on the national question and properly understood inter-nationalism, we support the self-determination of the Tamils, but not all nationalist organizations of the Tamils. Not the sell-outs of the Tamils who are now working with the government, selling out the independence of their nation to three masters, one the bourgeoisie, one of the Sinhalese, and since the Sinhalese are under the boot of the western imperialists, to them too. Thus, we oppose any chauvinism coming from anyone, Tamil or Sinhalese. We support the self-determination of the nations of Sri Lanka.</p><p name="c0d2" id="c0d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">10/7/2022</p><figure name="6470" id="6470" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Dh-L8E6Na02hSkSA" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Dh-L8E6Na02hSkSA"></figure><figure name="8f51" id="8f51" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*UFDD55GTT3Edv1Bg" data-width="1" data-height="1" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UFDD55GTT3Edv1Bg"></figure></div></div></section><section name="7a1e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5003" id="5003" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/18/on-the-protests-of-sri-lanka/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2022/08/18/on-the-protests-of-sri-lanka/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on August 18, 2022.</em></p></div></div></section>
