New wars are being ignited, and we see people who are freed from jail and are becoming leaders of a country.</p><p name="8492" id="8492" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such instances of the last example are taking place in Kyrgyzstan. Violence has become the norm for the country, and it seems the state has fallen to several different factions. After elections were held in 5 October, Opposition parties called the elections a fraud and started a proceed to overthrow the government by force. So far, at least one person is dead, 1000+ are injured, the white house is burned, jailed opposition figures are freed, and many people from the government (of ex. prime minister) have resigned. The president also proclaimed that he will resign soon. But lets see the situation from its start, who are the belligerents, and what domestic and external support they have?</p><p name="47da" id="47da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main competitors in the start were two, the government of Jeenbekov and the parties supporting it.</p><p name="92ba" id="92ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Various parties, ranging from social democracy to liberalism, with all having the common ground of favoring Russia as the big ally of Kyrgyzstan.</p><p name="4e1f" id="4e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other competitor is the opposition led by the former president of the country, Almazbek Atambayev and one of the richest bourgeoisie of the country Omurbek Babanov. The opposition is composed of a variety of parties, ranging from right wing conservative and liberals to some social democrats who back. Atambayev. Atambayev was freed by the protesters the first day of the protests, but was re arrested in 10 of October.</p><p name="597f" id="597f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is also the Ata Zurt which has factions inside the government coalition and outside of it. One of its leaders who were freed during the protests, Sady Japarov, was declared the new president. Russia announced that it had talks with all opposition figures, and it seems that this is essentially an inter capitalist dispute from the same group of pro-russian bourgeoisie.</p><p name="4325" id="4325" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems that there is no indication that a pro-western group has won the conflict, nor that there is any huge mobilization from the people. According to reports, no more than 10,000 people (from a population of 6 million) took part in the protests. Plus all leaders the opposition (save a smaller group which is the new young bourgeoisie, People’s Coordination Council and it will probably serve as the comprador bourgeoisie of the west in a future or even the current conflict) were political leaders of the previous governments, who all had a pro russian stance in general. Due to the fact that the protests are not massive in numbers, but «massive» in quality, (for example many places right now are under local groups, opposition leaders are being freed from jail, e.t.c) and that the parties involved are very similar with one another, the typical post socialist parties, plus the fact that there is not much official reaction from international actors, points us to think that this is an inter group bourgeoisie conflict, with many protesters being just henchmen of the opposing sub groups within the larger group.</p><p name="f119" id="f119" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is also a proof that the bourgeoisie are using popular discontent for their own use, and as there is no workers movement in Kyrgyzstan, it will be very hard for any protest to take any real socialist character.</p><p name="ac1a" id="ac1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nonetheless, there are reports that some protesters attacked Russian and Chinese owned companies but they left the Canadian owned gold mine in the country untouched.</p><p name="950e" id="950e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this case, we should remain vigilant on an event of a foreign backed coup de dat. The situation is such, that US-EU axis would use to put a government in their favor in power and try to distance the country from Russia and China and bring it closer to US.</p><p name="439e" id="439e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In short, it is too early to say what exactly are the forces being represented. About half of the population did not even participated in the elections, and not much are even participating in the recent conflict.</p><p name="52e6" id="52e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reporting is limited to just events, no communist movement exists in the country so we could cite, and in short we can’t give a full picture right now. The political landscape is changing rapidly, and we ask any comrade if he has any information on any socialist or workers party in the country, to give us their information or any news outlet if they have so we can also monitor the situation from non government or non western outlets. Kyrgyzstan is a very important strategical place, and if what is happening is a «color revolution» we, the communists out of this country, should know. We promise to keep monitoring the conflict for more events.</p><p name="e6d3" id="e6d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F. U.
