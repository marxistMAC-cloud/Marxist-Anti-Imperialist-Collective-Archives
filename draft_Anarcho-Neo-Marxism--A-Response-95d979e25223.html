On the contrary, this is the prevalent ideology among</p><p name="373d" id="373d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie, and consequentially, their labor aristocrats.

The upper stratum furnishes the bulk of the membership of co-</p><p name="f046" id="f046" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">operatives, of trade unions, of sporting clubs and of numerous religious sects. To this level is adapted the</p><p name="d59e" id="d59e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">electoral system, which in Great Britain is still “sufficiently restricted to exclude the lower stratum of the</p><p name="97b4" id="97b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">proletariat proper»!”</p><p name="1b82" id="1b82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was in 1916.

I think this was said with</p><p name="ae7b" id="ae7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">rhetorical intention, but if it was not then it is not really correct, there is not much feudal about the current</p><p name="1fff" id="1fff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">system, any more than feudalism was “neo-communalism”.

This is interesting to</p><p name="8291" id="8291" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">me, because the CPP-NPA itself does not claim to be a peasant organization, it claims to be a Communist Party,</p><p name="c5d7" id="c5d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">and thus, a proletarian party which is allied with the peasantry. But by calling it specifically a peasant</p><p name="fe3a" id="fe3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">organization, then you by yourself have demonstrated one of its greatest flaws, that it is not a proletarian party</p><p name="17e5" id="17e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">capable of carrying out a proletarian revolution, but a peasant association waging an armed struggle against a</p><p name="4da6" id="4da6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">state which is supported by the Proletariat. At the least, the implication is that it is a peasant association leading</p><p name="f7ac" id="f7ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the proletariat to struggle, similar to Nardoniks or other agrarian rebels, anarchists, etc. The original post I</p><p name="4170" id="4170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">made, I feel, does plenty to illustrate why this is a flawed line.</p><p name="bb0e" id="bb0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Secondly, the description of the Philippine government as a “amerikkkan-backed military dictatorship of</p><p name="a7ee" id="a7ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rodrigo Duterte”… this is really all sorts of wrong. I will start going backwards. While Duterte is the (elected)</p><p name="e572" id="e572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">president of the Philippine Republic, what is written here seems to indicate a lack of knowledge as to Duterte’s</p><p name="efb2" id="efb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">efforts to reduce his own office’s power through the introduction of federalism, which, naturally, necessitates a</p><p name="75d4" id="75d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">reduction of the President’s own powers. I won’t go into this, as it’s a topic in its own right, but to portray Duterte</p><p name="1166" id="1166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">as apparently illigitimate is unfair.</p><p name="b539" id="b539" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If he is not being portrayed as an illegitimate leader of the Philippines, despite being the elected</p><p name="e655" id="e655" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">president of the Philippines, then you are portraying what you believe to be a “brutal, amerikkan-backed military</p><p name="c7f3" id="c7f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">dictatorship” to be legitimate. Either way, I will let it speak for itself.</p><p name="706d" id="706d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Calling it a military dictatorship is outright wrong, to the point where it borders offensive. The</p><p name="f022" id="f022" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Philippines is not a military dictatorship, it is a democratic republic, and was set up by American imperialists</p><p name="c234" id="c234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">based on the US constitution. This is why Tagalogs occupy a similar position in the Philippines to the Whites in</p><p name="a30d" id="a30d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the US. Do you know how EU uses Ukrainians against Tatars and Russians in the Ukraine? It is the same</p><p name="6bbe" id="6bbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">concept.</p><p name="80f9" id="80f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Philippines is in the same general region as Myanmar, which is in the midst of a military junta’s</p><p name="b912" id="b912" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">rule, an actual military dictatorship. I would recommend studying the differences between the two state</p><p name="1ece" id="1ece" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">structures, you will find they are nothing alike.</p><p name="22db" id="22db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for “Amerikkkan-backed”, this is disingenuous. The most “backing” he has received from the US is</p><p name="275e" id="275e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">some rifles and helicopters, army modernizations, so forth that were ordered to help fight Abu-sayyaf (ISIS)</p><p name="82bd" id="82bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">militants in the south.</p><p name="6d25" id="6d25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Philippines is, by this logic, also “China-backed”, and also “Russia-backed”. And if this is our</p><p name="bc20" id="bc20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">criteria for what constitutes “backing”, then the fact that the CPP-NPA’s founder and leader Joma Sison lives in</p><p name="6063" id="6063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the Netherlands, gives interviews to the CIA and to American corporations like CNN, that he gave a speech in</p><p name="1295" id="1295" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hong Kong during the American-backed separatist protests, that the CPP-NPA often uses M14 rifles, etc., should</p><p name="2028" id="2028" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">be absolutely damning.</p><p name="3620" id="3620" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where does that leave us? If the Philippine Republic is US-backed, so too is the CPP-NPA. So who are</p><p name="de0c" id="de0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">we to support, neither?</p><p name="d7db" id="d7db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This line of reasoning is doomed to wind up at a dead end. The fact of the matter is that the Philippines</p><p name="a4de" id="a4de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">is a sovereign republic which is still partially under US occupation, an occupation that is slowly losing power by</p><p name="d9ee" id="d9ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">the day.</p><p name="e0da" id="e0da" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They twist the crucial analysis of Revolutionary Adventurism into a watered-down hymn suggesting</p><p name="2fdf" id="2fdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">that Maoists in general, “neither counted on nor hoped for any definite action or support on the part of the</p><p name="1367" id="1367" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">masses,” that the “enthusiastic proclamations” of the Maoist guerrillas about “armed struggle, about captured</p><p name="39f6" id="39f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">weaponry, about assassinated policemen” were disenchanting the people with the movement and endangering</p><p name="18d4" id="18d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">their lives. It is only possible to make this rightist error if you have hoodwinked yourself into believing that you</p><p name="dc90" id="dc90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">are the be-all-end-all of the class struggle.”</p><p name="770c" id="770c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is here that honest analysis begins more and more to be substituted with enraged proclamations.

I think Maoists</p><p name="59b8" id="59b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">perhaps do count on help, or hope for it, but I think this is regardless.

Violence is not bad on principle. The opposite, actually,</p><p name="b57d" id="b57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">revolutionary violence and terror is what has pushed history forwards since the beginning of time. But this is</p><p name="a23d" id="a23d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">something which must be done sparingly, and with an actual goal in mind. There has been no sincere tactical or</p><p name="6999" id="6999" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">strategic campaign launched by the CPP-NPA in its fifty years of existence. It peaked some decades ago, and has</p><p name="eb2a" id="eb2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">mostly relied on sporadic terrorist actives wherein any progress won is immediately swarmed upon by state</p><p name="aa1c" id="aa1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">reaction.</p><p name="f1eb" id="f1eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What, in this case, would be the “rightist error”? Insistence that we should support the state in its</p><p name="b7c0" id="b7c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">transition towards federalism and out of unitary republicanism, so that the various nations of the Philippines may</p><p name="fa54" id="fa54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">develop strong and organized proletarians capable of leading a revolutionary movement?
