<section name="8dd4" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="6460" id="6460" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">A Zionist Palestine?</h3><p name="32a5" id="32a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Seeing as there has been a change of policy from support to Israeli armed operations in the Gaza Strip to a condemnation of the settler ambitions headed by the UK and France, a short episode chastising the words of the Canadian prime minister caused confusion in the pro-Palestinian media: “ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Zionist Palestine</strong>”. Paraphrasing, one that has accepted the Zionist ideology while working alongside the Israeli security and economic networks for a regional integration into a dynamic system with Israel remaining as ground for all major infrastructure. That during these increasingly complicated absolutes presented by the Zionist entity for every negotiation in creation of a Palestinian state is expected when Israeli consultation in relation to what is a red line and to what is a terrorist organization is callous at best. That familiar “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Yes, Palestine will be ‘sovereign’ so long as it doesn’t have an airfield or even a border guard</em>!” Familiar Zionist sense for obduracy and ‘compassionate abuse’ is a characteristic having to be placated for what would be commonplace in one of the two states in this two-state solution, but the reality premises, beyond its principal characteristics, Israeli leadership of Palestine through conductor of world imperialism economy relays onto its entire economic fibre is a reality by Israel’s imperialist stature inside the encompassing Middle East.</p><p name="98a6" id="98a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the settlements across the West Bank, in alliance with both states with British capital, from which came the industrial parks, agricultural fields and the desalination plants for underground water reserves which Moshe Dayan expressed as the main cause of occupation of the West Bank. All theatres of state-backed construction in occupied Palestine employ Palestinian labour in all notable industries with the plus that their taxes will have no deductions in its transfer to their authority. Not to neglect Israel’s leading role in high-technology commodity chains and its integration into Silicon Valley, a constituted security role with the UAE, China, Vietnam and Myanmar and its support for all reactionary regimes in the region and just a general contempt for the military interests of Washington. Israel is to its neighbours the face of imperialist modernity.</p><p name="ad50" id="ad50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Indeed, Israel sees an obvious impression of the Palestinian people as working for far less; they see that their übermensch in the settlements actually garner little interest in developing their settlements. The great fields on the fringes of the West Bank perfect for agriculture would do little for an average Israeli family’s income; the competitive prices of settler goods are only maintained by extreme expenditure by the state, and those poor grandmas who ask “where will we go?” take no length of time when they’re forced to pack up during whatever peace treaty.</p><p name="73ff" id="73ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The military encroachment onto Palestinian territory may not have done away with the Zionist entity’s chauvinism and inhumanity but it has forfeited its princeling precipices. The Arabs, in the words of those in that perverted obsession spoken of in the Western world, of a people united by education and a despotic leadership, have travelled from what Zionists described as hamlets of stone and mud to a workforce of millions integrated into the imperialist world system at the benevolence of the Zionist consultation.</p><p name="b4aa" id="b4aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The relationship between Hamas and Fatah can be dismissed by some as traitor or warrior, from the perspective of a rocky start when the sway of unitary Sunni Islamist resistance became reified as the most popular position in Gaza in the 2006 elections. Both displacing the historical leadership of Fatah over all Palestinians in land or migration, and seeing the freezing of its Israeli-managed taxation for more than a year. The classical perception is that a secular-leftist organization has been overcome through bankrolling and tolerance by the rightist-Islamist movement in the fall of worldwide socialism; the second explanation is in context correct.</p><p name="a44b" id="a44b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The historical characteristic of Fatah has little room between insurgency and betrayal, or a promise of secularity and Brezhnev-approved third-worldism; it’s the lofty practice customary to fascist idealists, customary to those who threw their support at the Soviet Union which inspired the former cadres of the Muslim Brotherhood to form the PLO. The glaring betrayal of fascists to the masses inspired just as much the practice of Hamas breaking from the Muslim Brotherhood, accepting the concept of a nation-state.</p><p name="2153" id="2153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Zionist entity admits it fails to accomplish its historical position although they enjoy seeing the Islamic world’s reactionaries only cow and issue thin threats or pragmatic appeals for each and every advance Israel makes in the Gulf. While the Chinese nationalists in great rhythm cheered as Japan defeated the Russian Empire in 1905, witnessing its accepted regional leader establish an Asian Prosperity. It is the Abbas’, and the Sun Yat-Sens, the Wang Jingweis who give in to delusions of gradual growth and independence alongside the settlers as their brigands. Especially when Mahmoud Abbas, true to his predecessors from the Muslim Brotherhood, acted with American military forces under Keith Dayton to coordinate tribal militants to battle with Hamas militias.</p><p name="672e" id="672e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both Marxist-Leninist deviations comment on the Palestinian question as a people who’ve been pacified in their right to work. This fails to explain how Gaza, the home of dispossession for its relations with Hamas, became the anvil of revolution whereas resistance in the West Bank fails to connect with the overall movement. Even as their entire network of allies abandons them they continue battle after the most impressive military offensive in Palestinian history. It was enough for the PLO to see random outbursts of violence and peaceful resistance in lieu of transition from a region to a corporation. The successive Fatah governments in their maintained collaboration during the genocide have shown the dogshit journalists and academics which wished to show a charismatic Salam Fayyad and his hamster wheels fortifying the West Bank as but further homoerotic myths which only managed to throw Hamas out the door.</p><h3 name="9c78" id="9c78" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Chinese government of peace or the likely Briton one</h3><p name="f901" id="f901" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In terms without harshness, the promised coordination of a unity government between Hamas and Fatah is one between resistance and collaboration. A less than sub-par turnout but a necessary bridge between all Palestinian experiences and fractured bourgeois nonetheless. Vacillation with multiple allies between compromise and collaboration with a recognized imperial power is difficult to ascertain. A familiar strategy of Japan in the war of China was to provide what all bourgeois powers demand but rarely obtain: comparative technological power. The Guangxi clique headed by Li Zongren, the left wing of the rightist Chiang Kai-shek government, would receive top-of-the-line aircraft and training for their operation from the Japanese imperialists at little price and without conceited setback, something which bewildered the commander, himself having survived the battle of Shanghai.</p><p name="2f82" id="2f82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A unity will in equal part mean that Hamas’ executions and terror extended on all collaborators will not only be antiquated but unacceptable, and just the same for the coordination between Israel’s intelligence and Fatah’s death squads on all those accused of participation in Sunni organizations would become disreputable and offensive.</p><p name="ed17" id="ed17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Seeing as Britain couldn’t accept a rational Corbynite solution, the leader of a realistic British intervention in Palestine, the political and armed nature of Hamas is ratified as permanently terroristic by French and British contempt. The possibility of Fatah breaking off any dignity and inflicting a great terror on Sunni Islamist groups with overwhelming backing of the proposed government of peace is an expected sentence.</p><p name="bf3e" id="bf3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The conditions of the Islamic world are much worse than could ever be anticipated by realistic leftists, liberals and conservatives of the region. The premature fears which created the conditions for the whole world to accept the Algerian military coup. Although fears of jihads destroying minorities were magnified as slander from the mouth of Boutros-Ghali who when pressed about his own Copt interests stated “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the Copts are an integral part of Egypt, so if they are in danger, Egypt itself is in danger. But I am not worried, for the minorities are integrated geographically, socially, and institutionally. You’ll find Christian generals in the Egyptian army, for example. And that’s the case not only in Egypt, but also in Syria and other countries.</em> “ Seeing recent events in Syria prove that Arab regimes have degenerated to the point the defence of the nation-state is inferior against the secularized takfirists’ ability to attack Druze, Alawite, Coptic with the exception of peace with Jews.</p><p name="d7d8" id="d7d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The future of Palestine is looking to look more as a corporation than a nation-state, as all constituent parts of the Syriac nation in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria now. The fight must be prolonged by the dispossessed elements of society and the proletariat; it must be continuously communist and Islamist and must disestablish and expel the irrational Zionist state, a burden on international bourgeois law.</p><p name="0ffe" id="0ffe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stanton 22/11/25</p><figure name="9dd4" id="9dd4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*IsZWeIzybmT3aEQu" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IsZWeIzybmT3aEQu"></figure><p name="160c" id="160c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="f138" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="21f7" id="21f7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/11/22/a-zionist-palestine/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2025/11/22/a-zionist-palestine/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on November 22, 2025.</em></p></div></div></section>
