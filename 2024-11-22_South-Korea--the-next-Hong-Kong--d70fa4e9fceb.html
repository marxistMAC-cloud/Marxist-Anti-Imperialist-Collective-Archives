It’s hard currencies then used by institutions which would then acquire loans through intense negotiation before moving their workforce to then make more grand projects while the small shareholders break even. A mode of state led development that no one else followed (I swear), Has managed to decline the continuation of their people for the sake of their work.</p><p name="050e" id="050e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This precipitates the new question of the family, within the confines of individualist break. Its use, the trajectory, the family’s relationship that inclines its children. This continues absurdities such as communalism or the cynicism granting the role of state, demarcating the collective means and will to create family. This question will become more considerable in the region over time no doubt, especially seeing as the forces that lead in the crisis have already surrendered forms of aid and following dignity.

The legal weekly working time of 40 hours, with a ceiling of 12 possible hours of overtime, seems incompatible with family life for many workers.</em></blockquote><p name="43f9" id="43f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">What follows is an impending acceptance of foreign women as the answer, despite the Korean men who have seen no benefit beyond a friendship with women which takes no dual discipline in the time constraint they deal with, and the women who have been given their choice in childhood between lifting their skirt for their principal or clamping down on their personality.</p><blockquote name="cb42" id="cb42" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In early September, the government launched a program to encourage the arrival of domestic workers in this country of just over 51 million inhabitants.

For the past 20 years, Seoul has opened the door to migrants from Southeast Asia, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka. More recently, access to work visas for a larger number of pre-selected countries, such as Nepal, India and Lithuania, has been ordered.</em></blockquote><p name="0996" id="0996" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To understand the situation you must know the audience. For the considered social character of South Korea we can always turn to Shea.</p><blockquote name="069f" id="069f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The USA’s official stance on the Republic of Korea is that it’s a beloved ally and partner, because that’s what needs to be true for the occupation of Korea to remain stable. Underneath the surface-level rhetoric, however, are growing anxieties within the U.S. foreign policy establishment over how reliable of an ally the ROK truly is. These worries were articulated by the Council on Foreign Relations analyst Scott Snyder, who this year summarized why the alliance between Washington and Seoul could fail: “ </em>The rise of exclusive nationalism guided by ‘America First’ or ‘Korea first’ leadership that places national self-interest above alliance-based cooperation on shared challenges represents a point of vulnerability for the relationship. Combined with deepening political polarization in both countries, the cohesion and resilience of the U.S.-South Korea alliance may come under threat<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”<br>Though the ROK’s president Yoon Seok-yeol isn’t named here, it’s clear he’s one of these factors that’s making the empire concerned.<br>Seok-yeol isn’t even the most ideologically nationalistic politician, yet he’s been showing signs of putting the national interest over the hegemon’s interests. He’s refused to follow many of Washington’s most extreme plans for escalating with the DPRK, which alone is enough to make his government be seen by the U.S. with distrust. (…) a rift has been happening between Washington and Seoul.</em></blockquote><p name="ed3e" id="ed3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This of course is utterly dogshit and false, and all he speaks of is a conspiratorial way to establish the fact that capitalist systems always compete insofar as they can, before he embellished his work with a few lies. This confuses those who have been told that the right wing government of Korea is some sort of nationalist facade at the very least, in fact the new right is rather defined by its anti national character long planted by the insistence of a regional harmony appropriated by the military ‘bonaparte’ systems.

Since last year, there have been rumors that Yoon Seok-yeol “doesn’t know what country’s president he is.” In March 2023, Yoon Seok-yeol called for “ </em>third-party compensation<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> “ for the victims of forced mobilization by Japan. (…) In August, he suddenly announced that he would remove the bust of General Hong Beom-do at the Korea Military Academy. Yoon Seok-yeol’s pro-Japanese behavior has continued this year. For example, on July 27, Japan’s Sado Mine was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed to this, resulting in Sado Mine being registered as a World Heritage Site without properly specifying the forced mobilization that Japan carried out at Sado Mine.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="d17f" id="d17f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Strangely enough, Yoon Seok-yeol’s pro-Japanese treasonous acts began to become even more rampant ahead of this year’s Liberation Day. On August 7, Yoon Seok-yeol appointed Kim Hyung-seok as the director of the Independence Hall of Korea. Kim Hyung-seok is a well-known member of the so-called “New Right.” At his inauguration press conference on August 8, he stated, “ </em>There are parts that do not fit in the dictionary of pro-Japanese figures, and I will raise the issue so that no one is unfairly branded as a pro-Japanese figure<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”<br>Furthermore, on Liberation Day, an even more absurd thing happened. In his Liberation Day speech, Yoon Seok-yeol did not mention the past history of Japanese colonial rule at all, and only talked about absurd things like the “ </em>unification doctrine<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.” Even within the People Power Party, there was criticism about the absurd situation where the history of Japanese colonial rule was omitted from the Liberation Day speech, which is a day to commemorate our country’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Another thing that upset the angered public was the outrageous remarks of Kim Tae-hyo, the first deputy director of the National Security Office. When asked in an interview with KBS on August 16 whether the government was not able to say anything to Japan, Kim Tae-hyo made the outrageous remark that “what’s important is Japan’s feelings,” and that Japan cannot be forced to apologize when it does not like them</em></blockquote><p name="c7aa" id="c7aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This in line the with the increasing language of a new alliance aligned with NATO fomented by a weakened Japan and struck by a totality of the ROK, as far as it should exist under the political order. This frustrates the economist’s mind as he not only saw great potential in the North but an a strong industrial machine. This sends the Korean nationalist into a state of question and vulnerability, let us look at the last solution and its founding.</p><blockquote name="18f0" id="18f0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The Korean people’s firm belief in the need for the modernization was not derived from self-centered ultra- nationalism. Rather, the enthusiasm for modernization was the outcome of their tremendous effort to live peace- fully with all nations in Asia and the Pacific areas. Modernizing our nation is the only shortcut to unification of our divided land, and the most valid means of getting rid of the power vacuum. It is no exaggeration to say that the successful modernization of Korea serves as a compass indicating the direction of peace and security in East Asia.</em></blockquote><p name="b653" id="b653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">- Park Chung-hee, “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To Build A Nation</em> “ p.138.</p><p name="507e" id="507e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can the South Koreans form the structure for an independent and rich ROK in alliance with its neighbors, or will it choose once again between colonialism or socialism?</p><p name="3181" id="3181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stanton 20/11/24</p><figure name="3f14" id="3f14" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*5NKqwbQFSQZIHb-k" data-width="216" data-height="216" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5NKqwbQFSQZIHb-k"></figure><p name="db95" id="db95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Opinions stated in this article should be taken as those of the author, not the organization, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div></div></section><section name="870a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5af1" id="5af1" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/11/22/south-korea-the-next-hong-kong/" data-href="https://mac417773233.wordpress.com/2024/11/22/south-korea-the-next-hong-kong/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">http://mac417773233.wordpress.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on November 22, 2024.</em></p></div></div></section>
