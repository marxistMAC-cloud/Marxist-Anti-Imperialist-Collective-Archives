But before the Marxist-Leninist reader enters a “cultural shock” by seeing essentially Stalin being defied, I ask him to bare with my writing and forgive a few mistakes i might have here and there regarding information, and to focus mostly on my arguement. Marxism is not a religion, and anything and everything is subject to critique for further refinement of our theory, of course using the scientific methodology of marxism.</p><p name="a879" id="a879" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since Marxism is not a religious dogma, its main scientists and their theories are and should in fact, be subjects of criticism and dialogue. I hope that my small work here may enrich, even a little, the immortal science of Marxism.</p><p name="0e7b" id="0e7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before the reader comes to wild conclusions, i plead them to abandon religion and focus on the reality of my arguement, nothing else, nothing more. As the great teacher said:</p><blockquote name="70a3" id="70a3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Ist die Konstruktion der Zukunft und das Fertigwerden für alle Zeiten nicht unsere Sache, so ist desto gewisser, was wir gegenwärtig zu vollbringen haben, ich meine die rücksichtslose Kritik alles Bestehenden, rücksichtslos sowohl in dem Sinne, daß die Kritik sich nicht vor ihren Resultaten fürchtet und ebensowenig vor dem Konflikte mit den vorhandenen Mächten.</em></blockquote><h3 name="3ef0" id="3ef0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">BAUER AND STALIN</h3><p name="f1d8" id="f1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Marxists in their work, rarely speak about the national question, and the few times they speak, they mostly speak of it in negative terms, i.e, “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">since nations do exist, what we do to make their existence weaker?</em>”. From the early 1900s, Marxists came to the truth of the weight of the importance of the national question for the world’s labouring masses. The line of essential “anti-nationalism” that was spearheaded by plenty of socialists in europe, came to a halt after they clashed with the reality of the nation.</p><p name="2a48" id="2a48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marxists were some of the first to see this reality and take what was essentially a “pro-nationalist” position, and also the first to combat nationalism at the same time. This is because the Marxist movement at the time was not a monolithic movement, and plenty of internal ideological conflicts were present. The revolution after all had not yet come, and there was no “centre” to gather all people who were operating under the Marxist umbrella and give them a “monolithic” set of lines. Thus, the Marxists came to the “national question” through the arising of nationalism (national consciousness) among’s the masses who had broken from the pre-modern decentralized society of the village (where the whole centre of the world is the village and one’s own family, all being protected from the feudal lord who was god’s chosen ruler) and were now coupled in centralized citycentres.</p><p name="c634" id="c634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only the political unification of existing nations took place, but the definition of nations took shape in a crude form in the real world through the reality and the objective existance of the nation; the people of France, Italy, e.t.c, all came in the cities and found out that they did not speak the same language. In short, they werent one people, one nation. There was no scientific idea of the nation back then, so this inner feeling that “Italians”, “Ottomans”, e.t.c werent really one nation took (and even today, still takes), crude and primitive forms. Only the Marxists could create a theory that would break with the bourgeoisie notion of state=nation, and give a a scientific view of what is in fact, a nation, and why there was internal national conflict among’s the “Ottomans”, “Italians” e.t.c.</p><p name="25ac" id="25ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But one things becomes clear: if one wants to have a proper line on the national question, they first need to understand what is a nation to begin with. Likewise, if one wants to destroy capitalism, one needs to understand what capitalism is, same with the state, and same with every single thing. Else, this one will almost always be on the wrong, and the few times he will be on the right, it will be mostly from a combination of instinct and luck. This moment, the moment of the scientific explanation of what is a nation from the marxists, came in late 19st century to early 20st century, when Europe was still largely dominated by multinational formations.</p><p name="af8d" id="af8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At first, Otto Bauer came to give his own Marxist definition of what is a nation from his book “The question of nationalities and social democracy”.</p><p name="79e6" id="79e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We cannot quote the whole book, but the central thesis of Bauer can be understood from the following passage in our humble opinion: Is the nation a community of persons of common descent? Surely the Italians are descended from Etruscans, Romans, Celts, Germanic tribes, Greeks, and Saracens, the presentday French from Gauls, Romans, Britons, and Germanic tribes, the present-day Germans from Germanic tribes, Celts, and Slavs.</p><p name="0d68" id="0d68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or is it the community of language that unites human beings as a nation? Surely the English and Irish, the Danes and Norwegians, the Serbs and Croats, although in each case both speak the same language, do not therefore constitute one people; the Jews do not have a common language and yet they are a nation.</p><p name="7cd2" id="7cd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is it, then, the consciousness of a common bond that unites the nation? Should the Tyrolean peasant not be regarded as a German because he has never become conscious of his common bond with East Prussians, Pomeranians, Thuringians, and Alsatians? And furthermore, what is the German conscious of when he thinks of his “Germanness”? What makes him a member of the German nation, what connects him with other Germans? Surely an objective feature of this common bond must first be present before one can become conscious of it.</p><p name="eea7" id="eea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A systematic approach to the question of the nation must begin with a conception of national character. If we take any German to a foreign country, if we place him, say, among the English, he will immediately be conscious of the fact that he is among people different from himself, people with a different way of thinking and feeling, people whose reactions to the same external stimuli are quite different from those he finds in his usual German environ ment. For the moment, we will call the complex of physical and intellectual characteristics that distinguishes one nation from another its national character. Over and above these differences, all peoples share certain characteristics that identify us as human beings. On the other hand, classes, professions, and individuals within each nation exhibit distinctive qualities, particular features that distinguish them from one another. But the fact remains that the average German is different from the average Englishman, although they may well have much in common as human beings and as members of the same class or profession, and that the English share with one another a range of character istics, however much they are distinguished from one another by individual and social differences. What is important here are three things: For Bauer, a) common descent is not what defines a nation, b) neither is languange, c) Neither is land. What defines a nation? It is the following according to Bauer:</p><blockquote name="6e73" id="6e73" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">A nation is an aggregate of people bound into a community of character by a common destiny.</em></blockquote><p name="65b1" id="65b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This conclusion of Bauer is entirely based on the quote we gave. Lets take first common descent. What is the underlying feeling that bonds different people from different cities and families to all share this nationalist idea? The feeling that they all belong to a large family, i.e, that they have common descent. Obviously, common descent cannot be proved. Even at the level of the family, it can only be proved for sure due to recent Paternity test technology.</p><p name="b551" id="b551" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the past, only the mother could be sure that she is connected with the child, and the child knew for sure that it shared a common descent with its brothers through the mother. The father could not know, so in a practical level, the child could never be 100% sure if it shared a common descent with the cousins from his father’s side. One of the best ways for the father to know if a child was his, was to look at its direct physical characteristics; this is the source of the common idiom of “he looks like me” or “he takes from me”.</p><p name="3ace" id="3ace" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Among’s white, black, e.t.c people, there is not that much space for doupt, since most black people, white people e.t.c, look kinda alika among’s one another. If a wife is black haired, white, with hazel eyes, and father is black haired, white with hazel eyes, and their kid is black haired white, with hazel eyes, there is little doubt that the father is indeed the father in the mind of the father. If the kid has blue eyes, it could be explained by a grandfather with blue eyes, but a small doubt may arise on the father. If the kid has blue eyes and blond hair, the dump gets bigger.</p><p name="f97e" id="f97e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the kid is a black kid, the father is almost entirely certain that he is not in fact the father, and that the child of his wife is a product of an affair. The marriage breaks, and the bond of “common descent” which bonds families to share this feeling of what hegel called “particular altruism” is not formed among’s the kin of the man and the woman. Today, it is impossible to prove that all Albanians, Greeks, Italians, Maninke, Somalis, Potonghua, Russians e.t.c all have common descent. Thus, what is able to create this feeling of common descent necessary for a nationalist feeling to emerge? This is nothing more than their direct physical characteristics, i.e the color of their skin.</p><p name="6ebe" id="6ebe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To give an example, lets suppose that an English man studies Greek since a kid because he likes Herodhotus, Socrates e.t.c. By the time this man was a teeneger, he went to Greece every summer to hone his speaking skills, his understanding of Greek idioms, customs, and in general its specifics. By the time this man was 30 years old, he decided to change his name, from lets suppose James Smith, to Giorgos Papadopoulos, and go to Greece forever. Since the previous decade this man had honed his skill to being able to be a “Greek” to such a degree that about no one can understand really that he is an Englishman. If we suppose he becomes no president or anyone famous, no one will bother to actually find his backround. Thus, the secret of him being basically an Englishman who wishes to assimilate to the Greekdom, is known only to him. He is not Greek, but no one of his surrounding people knows this. At age this James turned Giorgos meets a a beautifull girl in the old woman of Athens, Plaka, during a nice summer clear night, courts her, and they end up getting attracted to each other and start dating. Lets name the woman Eleni. By the time James turned Giorgos is 35, he is married with Eleni and she expects a child. By the time James turned Giorgos is 45, his kid, lets say, Giannis, goes to elementary school, learns about Greek history, and is able to identify with it, is able to produce feelings of an “extended family” with the rest of Greekdom, i.e he becomes able to reproduce a nationalist feeling in his heart. When the other kids ask him his parents names, he will say Giorgos and Eleni, both proud greeks. By the time James turned Giorgos is 75, he dies from natural causes, taking his secret to his grave. Giannis, who is in reality half-english and half greek, keeps on being a full greek. He ends up married, producing offspring e.t.c, who all when asked will say that “we know that our grandparents, Giorgos and Eleni were greeks”. After these grandchildren make children, Eleni and James turned Giorgos wont even be remembered by anyone. The fact tha great grandparent was English will not be known to anyone. To understand why James was ever able to pass as a Greek, we need to produce another example.</p><p name="fc1b" id="fc1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Dinka man named Abdallah Abdelbagi from South Sudan is also enamored with Greek history, language e.t.c like James. He travels to Greece all the time like James to learn everything he can regarding it and like James, by the age of 30 he is also the same as a Greek in speach, manners, e.t.c. So, he decides to drop his name and adopt also Giorgos Papadopoulos. He goes to greece, and he finds himself unable to pass as a Greek, no one takes him seriously when he tries to claim the same ancestry with the rest of Greeks, and at some point, he meets the son of James turned Giorgos, Giannis. Abdallah turned Giorgos tries to explain to Giannis that he is Greek just like him. Giannis says the obvious, telling him he is mentally unstable to believe this, and that he is an African and is obvious and clear as the summer night of Athens. Abdallah is thus unable to fully assimilate to Greekdom, and other Greeks are unable to share mutually this feeling of “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extended family</em>” with him, even if he may share it himself. The love is not mutual. At some point, Abdallah marries a white skinned Greek woman. Their child is still dark skinned, whiter than him of course, but still dark enough for the rest of Greekdom to know immediately he is an African. An educated on the nation’s of Africa greek, will guess that he is from the more whiter nations in the borders of subharan africa with the saharan africa, but know that he is not Greek by any means.</p><p name="b57c" id="b57c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, the son of Abdallah is unable to from this bond with the rest of Greekdom like Giannis the son of James was. The son of Abdullah at some point marries a white Greek girl, and his kid while not being a blonde german, is white enough to be able to pass as a Greek. Lets name this kid Panagiotis. The father of Panagiotis, the son of Abdallah, dies when Panagiotis is in a car accident. Panagiotis after a while, decides that this is his chance to fulfil the dream of his late Grandfather Abdallah, and thus decides to hide who his grandparents and father were forever. He instead claims that his father was a Greek from a southern village, and that he was abusive and in bad terms with Panagiotis, so this is why Panagiotis does not want to speak about his father, and he pleads to his mother to play along the story to whoever asks and she agrees. At some point, Panagiotis marries a Greek girl, and he himself is able to pass as a Greek to her parents. Panagiotis mother dies, and the only one left knowing the secret is Panagiotis himself. He produces a child with his Greek wife, and at some point, Panagiotis dies too from lets say a bad disease. The secret of Abdallah took three generations to be wiped off, and this not because of someone’s will or something, but because it was at the third generation that this secret was even able to be hidden. Thus, the child of Panagiotis will keep saying and believing he is of common descent with the rest of Greekdom, and the love will be mutual.</p><p name="16c4" id="16c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the process of assimilation of a different color skinned person to be able to assimilate into another nation and be able to share with it this “descendship”. It takes at least 3 generations for this to happen, at the very least. It simply cannot happen before. For someone with the same skin color but from a different nation, this can start from point A, with the first generation immedialty.</p><p name="0688" id="0688" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, in general it too takes 3 generations because people rarely go to such a length to hide their past, but it is possible to happen in one generation. This is why contrary to what Bauer believes, historical constitution, i.e the “forgetting” is very important for the feeling of nationalism to develop across different individuals.</p><p name="3c4f" id="3c4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If one removes historical constitution, one can remove a great part of what it means to form one very basic thing, central behind nationalism in the individual’s level. Bauer confuses the actuality of commond descendship with its practical manifestation. Since Italians cant know if their great grandparents were Etruscans, Celts, Germanics or Gaelics, they all formulate this feeling on the basis of thier phisicial characteristics, i.e skin color (in cases facial characteristics arent extremelly different than the others, i.e east asian lets say).</p><p name="64bc" id="64bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, Bauer is wrong on this one, even if he knows that “the nationalist feeling” is important for the manifestation of nationalism in the individual level. But Bauer attributes this not to the feeling described above, but to what he calls “a community of character”, including the “national characteristics” of a group, which can be anything. Before the reader attacks us with the charge that we try to say things Bauer did not say, hold on a little dear reader, and calm your horses. We are able to say what we say, because when Bauer removes language as what defines a nation, Bauer is essentially saying that “Culture” is what defines nationhood. Therefore the Jews are a nation. What does it means to say that Jews, bound only by religion, are a nation? In its logical conclusion, nothing at all. It means that if “culture” defines nationhood, then capitalism which destroys culture and mingles it into a single pot to produce its cosmopolitan culture also makes nations non-existand. In its imperialist stage, culture is almost extinguished from the day to day live of a X country. Everyone in Europe hears American music, watches american filsm, and even speaks English as a second language to some degree. Thus, according to Bauer all Europeans are actually one nation, and soon, all people of the world, Africans, Asians, everyone is a nation. This is the logical conclusion of removing language as a primal factor determining nationhood. Bauer uses a good situation, but gives it bad specifics for his example. Take a German and ship him in England, the first thing that becomes apparant is not the different culture, way of life or anything, but the language. The german wont be able to understand much. Only if he knows good german linguistics, may be able to understand a very few things, due to English being a germanic language. Therefore, while the German understands he is of a different nation immediatly since he cant even communicate, he understands that there was some common history with the English at the past, so at a very mild level, is able to develop a far away “nationalist feeling” (nationalist is wrong to call it, but we hope the reader understands what we want to convey).</p><p name="7cfc" id="7cfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take the German and ship him to Italy, he wont be able to develop this feeling becuase Italians are entirelly a 10 different “Race” (by race we mean here language groups, i.e Slavs, Romance, Germanics e.t.c), and their language is in almost every way different to german. The german, whoever good he knows linguistics, wont be able to make out many things, only perhaps loaned words that passed out due to contact between two different set of people in the past centuries. Thus, it is language which determines essentially if someone is a different nation or not. It is language which basically splits one set of people from another.</p><p name="09be" id="09be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bauer, when he claims that people speaking different languages can be nations, puting in the place of language a “national character”, is in fact being an idealist, unscientific arguementator for a second time. Baur is denying that nations are objective things, even if he claims the opposite. He denies this, becuase he claims that people who share a same culture (as we said, cultures with capitalism become more and more homogenuz — the phenomenon of Cultural homogenization -, and thus per Bauer, nations should be insignificant — just seeing europe is obvious it is not especially in what we call the “west”, where Cultural homogenization is almost entirelly finished as far as it concerns day to day activities.) can be one nation. What does this means? It means that europe can be largelly divided into three nations, “western”, Eastern orthodox, and the in betweens like Serbs and Albanians who share different religion. If we put Europe in word context, we can say that it is one and single nation constrast to the Islamic horde of the middle east and the Kunfukian Mongolic horde of the far east. This is not nationalism, neither is a scientific view of the nation; this is nothing more than bourgeoisie cosmopolitanism, having taken shape by following some sort of the idealist understanding of the being. Nation is not an objective fact outside of the individuals will, but a subjective fact within the will of the individual.</p><p name="847d" id="847d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A jew is member of the “Jewish nation” as long as he believes in the magic SkyJew, and the moment he learns about science and starts doupting there is indeed a sky-jew sending cancer to little children, and at the end, dropes the Jewish religion alltogether, what he is then?</p><p name="fb21" id="fb21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leave it to Bauer to explain and then try to follow the logical conclusion of this line. In this aspect, Bauer’s explanation is not marxist and scientific, throught his book is a good book for its time.</p><p name="6f41" id="6f41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some years later, the Georgian Joseph Stalin tried to formulate a national policy for the Bolshevik party, very importand for the context of Bolshevik activism in one of the most multinational empires in europe at the time. The most diverse area was nothing more than Caucasus, which was overtly multinational compared to the other places with similar size, propably due to the mountanius area which made it possible for different nations to find it hard to assimilate others. Stalin being a georgian was from the Caucasus, and he had knowledge of the multinationalism of the world in its real essence and not the romantic essence given by the bourgeoisie and the Bauerists of the world since his very birth. Stalin in his book “Marxism and the national question” sets forth an arguement for the bolshevik policy on the national question (again, Stalin gives the word “nationalism” an universal negative meaning in general, but also not claiming that nations should and will dissapear by design, or that they dont exist. He says proletarian internationalism — what we mean in this current word when we say proletarian nationalism against bourgeoisie nationalsim), but for him to do that, he needs to define what is a nation.</p><p name="b7a9" id="b7a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will give Stalin’s final definition: A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture. Fourther, he ends up a few lines later writing the following: It is only when all these characteristics are present together that we have a nation. Stalin is far above Bauer or anything presented before, but Stalin’s definition is not entirelly scientific. After all, science is linear, i.e, it is build on the scientific advancements of the previous scientists, purgin nonscientist parts and further adding up scientific discoveries, and repeat by the next generations. But we are not the kind of opportunists to claim that “X stalin said does not apply becuase ‘it is another time’ or ‘because i feel like it’, no. If we are to say that Stalin is wrong, we need to explain in detail our arguement, just like Stalin did in regards to Bauer.</p><p name="8a8f" id="8a8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need to take the characteristics that Stalin gives and their context one by one.</p><p name="e012" id="e012" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1)historical constitution</strong>: The examples Stalin gives are the following: This community is not racial, nor is it tribal. The modern Italian nation was formed from Romans, Teutons, Etruscans, Greeks, Arabs, and so forth. The French nation was formed from Gauls, Romans, Britons, Teutons, and so on. The same must be said of the British, the Germans and others, who were formed into nations from people of diverse races and tribes.</p><p name="e072" id="e072" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people. On the other hand, it is unquestionable that the great empires of Cyrus and Alexander could not be called nations, although they came to be constituted historically and were formed out of different tribes and races. They were not nations, but casual and loosely-connected conglomerations of groups, which fell apart or joined together according to the victories or defeats of this or that conqueror. Further from a little more bellow in the book: A nation is not merely a historical category but a historical category belonging to a definite epoch, the epoch of rising capitalism.</p><p name="e95e" id="e95e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The process of elimination of feudalism and development of capitalism is at the same time a process of the constitution of people into nations. Such, for instance, was the case in Western Europe. The British, French, Germans, Italians and others were formed into nations at the time of the victorious advance of capitalism and its triumph over feudal disunity. To take the first quote, we need to mention that Stalin here mostly speaks of what we spoke on historical constitution, fortgetting e.t.c, but he does not speak much about the emotion which gives the nation a political manifestation, merelly he says that since modern nations have different ancestries within the white skinned people in Europe, the historical constitution refers to the mingling up of these different people’s into one, i.e their assimilation from multiple entitities to one, their development from quantity to quality.</p><p name="fa7c" id="fa7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reader can consider our above work regarding Bauer, if they feel that our additions have any meaning at all, as an addition and refinement at what the characteristic of Historical constitution means. Now to go to the second part, here Stalin shows one instance that he is wrong, and in fact, he goes against his own definition. Stalin says that the “nation is a historical category of a definite epoch, the epoch of capitalism”.</p><p name="a682" id="a682" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is contrary to Stalin’s own characteristics. Stalin uses as an example for this addition the following:</p><blockquote name="2001" id="2001" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The process of elimination of feudalism and development of capitalism is at the same time a process of the constitution of people into nations. Such, for instance, was the case in Western Europe. The British, French, Germans, Italians and others were formed into nations at the time of the victorious advance of capitalism and its triumph over feudal disunity.</em></blockquote><p name="ff16" id="ff16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Here it is obvious Stalin is confusing nationalist consciousness, which can only develop indeed with capitalism for the reasons we wrote about at the beggining of our work, with the very nation itself. This is not based on Materialism, but is based on Stalin trying to fit his own concept of nation as a “product of capitalism”, which is a “vestige” of the anti-nationalist sentiments that were if not dominant, a big presence is the socialist movement in reality. Even, we could say that Stalin contradicts himself when he says that a nation can exist without a state (this means naturally, not only that a nation can exist within a multinational state, but that a nation can exist in its opposite, i.e in multiple states, i.e feudal states) in this passage, since what happened with capitalism and its triumph against Feudalism? Centralization of populations, their natural arisal of nationalist concsiousness, and the demand of the economy which needed a centralized nation-state.</p><p name="ef0b" id="ef0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, capitalism did not create the nation as stalin claims here, it just merelly created the basis for the political manifestation of the nation, and to be more specific, the concept of the unified nation-state and that a nation should be unified under one national leadership. This to me, is understood as a big mistake (claiming that nations did not exist before) by Stalin in a letter work of his, when he implicitly admits that nations existed before, but they were “splintered”. To quote:</p><blockquote name="c4d8" id="c4d8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">There are different kinds of nations. There are nations which developed in the epoch of rising capitalism, when the bourgeoisie, destroying feudalism and feudal disunity, gathered the parts of nations together and cemented them. These are the so-called “modern” nations. You assert that nations arose and existed before capitalism. But how could nations have arisen and existed before capitalism, in the period of feudalism, when countries were split up into separate, independent principalities, which, far from being bound together by national ties, emphatically denied the necessity for such ties? Your erroneous assertions notwithstanding, there were no nations in the pre-capitalist period, nor could there be, because there were as yet no national markets and no economic or cultural national centres, and, consequently, there were none of the factors which put an end to the economic disunity of a given people and draw its hitherto disunited parts together into one national whole. Of course, the elements of nationhood-language, territory, common culture, etc.-did not fall from the skies, but were being formed gradually, even in the precapitalist period. But these elements were in a rudimentary state and, at best, were only a potentiality, that is, they constituted the possibility of the formation of a nation in the future, given certain favourable conditions. The potentiality became a reality only in the period of rising capitalism, with its national market and its economic and cultural centres.</em></blockquote><p name="637b" id="637b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Stalin here finds himself admitting implictly that he is wrong, but for him to admit it explicitly, he needs to abandon the view that culture and economy determine the nation.Thus, at the start of this quote Stalin says explicitly that Capitalism unified the separated parts of the nations, only to claim that nations did not exist before just in the lines bellow, becuase the political entities that existed did not wish this unification into one, and because there was no “ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a single culture and national economy</em>”. Thus, Stalin would need to withdraw his statement regarding that “if only one characteristic is missing, the nation ceases to be”.</p><p name="6e30" id="6e30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will prove later why a national economy and culture are irelevant to determine the nation, for now we will focus on explaning the contradiction on Stalin’s line. The contradiction is as follows: per Stalin, a nation does not exist before capitalism, becuase of separated economies, cultures and states (?) (we put the question mark, because it is obvious in the same work that Stalin explicitly says that a nation does not need a unified state to exist, but at the same time he implies it needs it, i.e it is an open contradiction, while the two others are not hidden). What is the hidden contradiction here? Lets suppose Stalin is completelly right in his definition, and that it is enough for a different economy and culture to exist for there to be no nation. If we follow this, we end up in the following conclusion: nations not only existed since the beggining of manking, but in fact will keep existing even if the world population starts speaking one language tommorow.</p><p name="8e30" id="8e30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s explain what we mean in detail. As a methodology and definition of the nation, we will do nothing more than taking the definition of stalin as per word.</p><blockquote name="492c" id="492c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.</em></blockquote><p name="323b" id="323b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Lets take the primitive human community and lets see if it fits the criteria of Stalin. Does the primitive human community haves a stable historical constitution? Yes, it has. They all share the same idea about their descent, and they all share and have “their history, beggining and their end”, and they all share a stable community of people, a network of families e.t.c. Does the primitive human community haves a common language? Yes it has, else there would not be a community to begin with. They all have a common form of communication, i.e a common language so they are able to even function. Does the primitive human community haves a common territory? Yes it has, they have their common territory where they hunt their game, have their homes, e.t.c. Does the primitive human territory haves an economic life? Yes it has, the primitive human territory operates in fact with a higly centralized economic system, where produce and consuming has a social character within the community. Does the primitive human territory haves a psychological make up, manifested in a common culture? Yes they have, they have one religion, one set of legends, one village magician, one set of names e.t.c. The same could be applied for a feudal village, for a capitalist city, and for a future communist continent. Thus, by Stalin’s own criteria, the criteria of his historical constitution, Culture and economy, can at best split one nation in two nations, not wipe out the nation alltogether. Thus, it could be said by Stalin’s criteria, that nations existed fully before capitalism, and it was in capitalism that the procces of the assimilation of different smaller nations sharing the same “characters” (i.e language and appearance) became and they formed bigger nations. But to claim they did not exist before, is contrary to Stalin’s own definition. Nonetheless, we managed to keep the scientific from Stalin’s first criteria and purge the unscientific from the contradictions within its use by Stalin. Now lets go to the second</p><p name="8320" id="8320" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2) Common language</strong>: This in our opinion is the strongest divider between two people who are able to share the fantasy of a common descent (i.e within groups with close phisical characteristics, like Subsaharan africans, europeans, east asians e.t.c).</p><p name="99d4" id="99d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my opinion, this is the great contribution of Stalin in the scientific investigation regarding the national question and regarding the understanding of nations in general. Throught, there are again, contradictions in this characteristics insofar as how Stalin applies them. Stalin writes the following:</p><blockquote name="abd8" id="abd8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It is possible to conceive of people possessing a common “national character” who, nevertheless, cannot be said to constitute a single nation if they are economically disunited, inhabit different territories, speak different languages, and so forth. Such, for instance, are the Russian, Galician, American, Georgian and Caucasian Highland Jews, who, in our opinion, do not constitute a single nation. It is possible to conceive of people with a common territory and economic life who nevertheless would not constitute a single nation because they have no common language and no common “national character.” Such, for instance, are the Germans and Letts in the Baltic region. Finally, the Norwegians and the Danes speak one language, but they do not constitute a single nation owing to the absence of the other characteristics. And: Thus, a common language is one of the characteristic features of a nation. This, of course, does not mean that different nations always and everywhere speak different languages, or that all who speak one language necessarily constitute one nation. A common language for every nation, but not necessarily different languages for different nations! There is no nation which at one and the same time speaks several languages, but this does not mean that there cannot be two nations speaking the same language! Englishmen and Americans speak one language, but they do not constitute one nation. The same is true of the Norwegians and the Danes, the English and the Irish. But why, for instance, do the English and the Americans not constitute one nation in spite of their common language? Firstly, because they do not live together, but inhabit different territories. A nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation. But people cannot live together, for lengthy periods unless they have a common territory. Englishmen and Americans originally inhabited the same territory, England, and constituted one nation. Later, one section of the English emigrated from England to a new territory, America, and there, in the new territory, in the course of time, came to form the new American nation. Difference of. territory led to the formation of different nations. Here, again, Stalin tries to fit his ideal to the existing world by force. Stalin, for some reason, needs to justify the existance of many states, and thus the state (which stalin expicitly says plays no role in determining the nation) is what “makes nation”. This is a contradiction with his own thought.</em></blockquote><p name="266a" id="266a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To explain in detail, Stalin correctly shows (pretty much in the way we explained against Bauer, again we hope we addet something of substance) that if two people who cannot even understand each other constitute one nation, then the concept of the nation is meaningless and it can be anything. But instead of taking this to its natural conclusion, i.e, that in general, people who can share the fantasy of a common descent and speak the same language are indeed in fact, one nation, he says that one langueage does not mean one nation. Examples are for him the Irish and English, Americans and English, Danes, Swedes and Norwegians. First, regarding Ireland, Stalin is wrong regarding information, since Irish language was still largelly in use at the time, thus by his definition it existed an Irish nation speaking Irish. Regarding Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, well, his arguement is that they “Lack economic life and culture”.</p><p name="c20b" id="c20b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lets take this into a context. The Russian Moscovite in Stalin’s time had a different culture than the Russian peasant in the villages around Moscow. Entirelly different way of life, different culture (the urbanite’s spiritual world was Dostoyevski, the Vladivostok’s peasant’s Perun, grandma’s fairytales, and at best the bible, if he would be able to even read), and for sure, different economic life. The Vadivostok’s peasant was propably working in the agrarian industry, selling something, consuming the rest, e.t.c, and the Urbanite consuming the peasant’s agricultural product and propably doing a job as a writer for other urbanites to read. His connection to the peasant was “one way”. As far as the peasant was concerned, he had no relation to him or to most people from Moscow. Was the Russian peasantry constituting a different nation from the Russian urbanites? Sure, there was cultural and economic relations, but this was the case even in feudal times, and for sure the case among’s Norwedians, Swedes, and Danes. Thus, it can be understood, that driven to its logical conclusion, the Korean people form two different nations, so are the Arabs, the Albanians, Serbs, Greeks, e.t.c, in short, this policy in the end of the day is not only incoherent if taken in actual world context (justifing the existance of useless statelets) but is also reactionary in its application. Imagine, the Koreans according to Stalin’s definition form two different nations! Finally, where he is wrong again, is regarding US and UK. Quite obviusly, they from one and single nation, alongside the English speaking white Canadians and Australians (and New Zealanders).</p><p name="5dea" id="5dea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stalin’s main arguement here is distance, but this arguement again is false; distance plays no role here, becuase it is not as if the route from UK to Canada and US, and then to Oceania is filled with different nations, it is in fact, nothing more than sea, where fish and sharks dwell, surelly no human societies. As far as “territorial continuity” is concerned, these places do have a territorial unity through the sea. It could be argued that the English speaking whites of north America form the centre of the English nation nowadays, in all terms, economical, political, cultural, and the english speaking white populations of England, Australia, New Zealand, form the “islands” of this nation. Per its size, the English nation is neither the first or the last disconnected by sea, the same is the case of the Cypriot Greeks and Mainland Greeks, Balearic islands and Catalonia, and if we take it purelly by distance, the biggest distance from the shores of England and Canada is 1985 miles, with a combined size of 5,100,000 million Sq meters. If we take mainland Greece and Cyprus, their distance is 600 miles for a combined size of of 60,000 sq m. If we divide it, for every mile between mainland Greece and Cyprus there is 100 Sq miles of territory, i.e 1%. For England and Canada, the distance is about 2500 sq miles per mile, i.e 0,5% of its territory. By relative terms, England and Canada are two times closer with one another than Greece and Cyprus. In the same manner, if distance is the issue, the distance from Crimea to Vladivostok is 5,600 miles, i.e 2,5 times bigger than the distance of England and Canada. If distance is the issue, then the Vladivostok Russians ought to make their own self-determination and republic! To close this chapter, the issue is that Stalin should have been upfront; no, Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, arent separate nations. They speak one language, look the same, they mingle together, they are one nation. Same with the Anglo Saxons (who fit anyway this criteria nowadays, even if we take Stalin’s definition per word)</p><p name="c64d" id="c64d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notheless, it should be open that the strengh of this characteristing is the dividing factor. Two languages = two different nation’s, period. It is true that same language does not always means the same nation, but stalin applies it in wrong examples as showed. Here, we need to combine the two main characteristics, i.e, historical constitution and language. What we mean by this? We mean that two concetrated territories of white english speaking people, and black english speaking people, form two different nations. They may be able to communicate, but they are unable to form one national consciounsess, one nationalist feeling, the feeling of a family and of common descent. We have wroten extensivelly on this i think, and the point has by now hopefully transfered to the reader.</p><p name="4a18" id="4a18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3) Territory</strong>: Besides what we already wrote above, it should be said for practical reasons, debate needs to be given regarding when two same speaking communities are divided by a long territory inhabited by different people. Political solutions here could be population transfers and territorial exhanges.</p><p name="9f4c" id="9f4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even here, since the invasion of aerial means of transport and communication, the practical meaning of this has been becoming weaker by the day. Today for example, even by the design of the bolsheviks, who followed the Stalinist line on the national question, such solution were given. For example Kalilingrad and mainland Russia are divided by the baltic nations, Belarus and Poland. Azerbaijan was divided from its western and eastern territory from Armenia. It is obvious that the bolsheviks themselves did not take this line as absolute.</p><p name="1da1" id="1da1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4) economic life</strong>: Here again, we already said a lot. Stalin uses economic life as a way to divide nations (i.e, to say that mediaval georgians werent one nation), and he even tries to use this arguement as a way to say nations did not exist before becuase they had no unified economy (we explained before why per Stalin’s own definition, this is not true, thus we wont dwell more into it).</p><p name="fa93" id="fa93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In our opinion, this is the weakest arguement and element. A nation can be splitted artificially economically without any historical constitution taking place. East and West Germany was splitted in two during the cold war, and their economices not only did not have much relation, but operated under completelly different political and economic systems; a liberal parliamentary democracy, against a people’s soviet democracy, a capitalist economy under the “christiandemocrat” social-democratic mechanism, and a socialist economy under a central plan. Dues this means that from 1945 to 1950 Germany became suddenly two different nations, only to be become one nation in the 90s again? This ignores completelly the historicity of nationhood, and is a clear mockery if taken in its natural conclusion towards the very concept of natiohood. In short, it contradicts stalin’s other criteria.</p><p name="aed6" id="aed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This criteria is therefore, self-contradictory. But if we wish to apply it to today, it can lead to some very reactionary conclusions. Trade and economic relations between ROK and DPRK are almost non- existand. Their curent psychological make up is entirelly different for the masses of their states. The masses of ROK listen to liberal garbage K-POP music, watch liberal movies about how the Masons make people kill each other for their amusement in Netflix, and have in general a cosmopolitan and self-hating attitude rising day by day (Korean women and men make surgeries to look more “western”). The complete opposite is happening in the masses of DPRK; they listen to a mix of socialist, heroic and classical music of the opera style, watch nationalist anti-imperialist films, and their artist is based on socialist realism. Not only self-hating is not in rise in DPRK, but what is on rise is the love and admiration for their own self, and for what they really are. Thus, is the Korean nation in fact, not a nation anymore, but separated into two? This assertion is completelly idealistic and unscientific, becuase then every country that is at civil war is divided into two nations since the civil war pre-essuposes a huge stratification of the masses of the nation, and whatever this implies regarding the economic organization of rebel held and government held areas and the culture these sides enjoy.</p><p name="c3b0" id="c3b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5) Psychological make-up manifested in a common culture</strong>: Everyting we said about the economy, could easily be said here. The less centralization on big cities has taken place on the nation, the more distict cultures exist within it. Even highly centralized nations still exhibit this phenomenon in the far edges of their territory, for example Greece’s Cretan culture is very different from the neomodern culture existing in athens. The music they listen, their cultural norms, almost everything is different, even their dialect. If one goes to Cretan villages they will see plenty of people wearing the clasical cretan black robe and belt, in athens one would be seen as going to a cultural festival or something. No one wears these clothes in Athens for day to day activities, rather they all wear the western imported fashion of blue jeans, synthetic jackets or t-Shirts made in Bagladesh and Addidas and Nike shoes. Does this mean we have an Athenian and Cretan nation?</p><p name="6903" id="6903" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we go to places even more decentralized by population, like Albania, there is a clear difference of northen Albanians, were they still live by the barbarian prewestern costums in the northern tribes than the rest of the nation. The Albanians may have been the only warrior nation in europe by the early 1900s. Austro-Hungarians reported that their Albanian mercenaries during the first world war, would keep pony tails in their head and shave their head in weird ways as to cut the heads of their dead enemies and hang their heads in their belt and neck and shake them for blood to drop from the severed heads to their body and use this as a psychological shock for the enemy and a trans-like status for their own self, reminding us the Norse legends of the Berserker.</p><p name="fb2a" id="fb2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such a phenomenon was unique to the Albanians, specifically their northern tribes, who while were “following” Jew religions (imported) like Christianism and Islamism, it is obvious that these costums are survivals of ancient pagan ways of life, mixing them up with the new religion. The picture was completely different in the south of the nation, where such barbaric ways did not exist anymore, and what existed was peasant culture owning to the peasant economic way of life of its inhabitants. Does this means that the albanian from Elbasan was a different nation from the Albanian of Mirdita? If we could use this assertion, we could carve up different nations among’s the city dwellers and the peasantry, and then among’s the bourgeoisie and the proletariat within the cities, and then among’s the diversification of the youth nowadays within the urban centers, were we have different types of sub-cultures.</p><p name="c7b6" id="c7b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, a peasant changes nations if he goes to the city and starts following up the city culture and economy? Obviously not. To close this chapter, from the characteristics that Stalin gives, we can carve up the importance for nationhood they have: First of all, there is the historical constitution. Whatever happens, this doesn’t mean we dont have a nation, else the nation would be devoid of its objective nature (and thus, dialectic nature) and be a creation of imagination, something artificial made not from the human society but out of it. It would be therefore something idealist and a matter of self-identification and subjectiveness. The specific characteristics of this characteristics, i.e, the skin color for example (or extreme facial characteristics) is the most importand part not in general, but when we have two communities of people speaking the same language but having an obvious different “ancestry”.</p><p name="320d" id="320d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we have people who look close in facial characteristics and skin color, the most importand signifier of the nation is not skin color (which here, is mostly irrelevant since there are no such concetraded communities) but the language. What separates immediatly thes people is communication, something out of them and something objective. This also becomes the most importand unifier. Send a Serb, a Croat and a Bosnian in an abandoned island, and they would be able to mingle perfectly. Send an atheist serb, atheist croat, and atheist bosnian, and they will have no way to distinc their own self on anything. Send a Serb, an Albanian, and a Greek, the propably wont be able to form a serious way of communication till the end of their lives. This is becuase we speak not only of three different nations, but of three different races. Send a Serb, a Bulgar, and a Slovenian into an abandoned island, and they will be able to share a common fantasy of ancestry, since it is obvious by their languages that they are somehow heavenly related. They wont be able to communicate in a serious manner, becuase they do are three different nations, but if they are to stay lets say, for 20 years in the island, they will be able to understand perfectly one’s another’s language. We will speak more on this later. Regarding territory, of course it is importand for two reasons: it is the basis of anything to exist, since people dont live in the skyes. Besides of that, a coherent territory makes able the fantasy of common ancestry to come about. We speak here about internal migration, from village to village and city to city. This mingling up of the populations of different nations make able the rise of nationalism and the nationalist feeling. The economy and culture arent actual dividers, while they are obstacles towards the nation’s political (i.e, not objective) unity. The more diverse the economy is and the more diverse the culture is, the more hard is for the nationalist consciousness to develop between the masses, and the more hard is for them to go out of the “village” mentality to the “national” mentality. But this does not concerns the existance of the nation as such, i.e, as an indepentent of human’s chosing existance, only its manifestation into a political being, i.e a nation-state. We will explain later their importance. For now, we will give what we consider a more scientific version than Stalin’s definition from 100 years ago, in the following:</p><p name="0183" id="0183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A nation is a historically constituted community of people sharing the same language. Before we finish this chapter for good, we need to specify for last time what we mean by historical constitution and of language. By historical constitution is to be meant: The ability to create a fantasy of common ancestry, which pressuposes that the process of “forgetting” among the masses has take place, i.e, that they cant trace their ancestry from the past century or tow, and that to be able to even have this fantasy, to look at least to some degree.</p><p name="c986" id="c986" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">F.
